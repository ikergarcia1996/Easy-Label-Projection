It O
is O
therefore O
not O
difficult O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
with O
the O
publication O
of O
a O
book O
about O
refugees O

displaced O
persons O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
from O
1945 O

, O
to O
attract O
attention O
. O

And O
indeed O
there O
are O
hardly O
any O
serious O
scientific O
discussions O
that O
have O
taken O
up O
this O
subject O
so O
far O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
such O
a O
topicality O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
an O
undoubtedly O
imminent O
debate O
to O
deprive O
it O
of O

In O

Albrecht O

to O
adopt O
a O
neutral O
, O
free O
perspective O
from O
guilt O
assignments O
and O
innocence O
confessions O
towards O
a O
policy O
and O
its O
consequences O
, O
which O
led O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC

when O
twelve O
million O

In O
what O
way O
the O
" O

- O
as O
it O
was O
called O
immediately O
after O

with O

1948 O
- O
found O
in O
their O
new O
circumstances O
and O
how O
these O
experiences O
have O
been O
traditional O
over O
the O
next O
decades O
in O
the O
different O
generations O
until O
today O
, O
Lehmann B-PER
demonstrates O
by O
means O
of O
a O
series O
of O
stories O
, O
personal O
records O
, O
diary O
and O
documents O
of O
the O
distributed O
press O
. O

Today O
promoted O
is O
an O
image O
, O
which O
, O
although O
little O
surprising O
, O
but O
in O
its O
composition O
convincing O
readers O
and O
readers O
allows O
the O
refinement O
of O
a O
specific O
kind O
of O
foreign O
experience O
. O

The O
respective O
experiences O
and O
their O
coping O
are O
presented O
quite O
differently O
. O

Certain O
topics O
, O
however O
, O
appear O
again O
and O
again O
: O

Thus O
, O
the O
rape O
of O
German B-MISC
women O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
led O
not O
only O
to O
irreparable O
mental O
disorders O
among O
the O
women O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
complicated O
marriage O
relationships O
, O
which O
often O
dominated O
the O
life O
of O
entire O
families O
for O
years O
after O
these O
events O
. O

The O
design O
from O
the O
old O
home O
produced O
in O
not O
few O
cases O
forms O
of O
social O
overload O
, O
which O
especially O
in O
close O
village O
communities O
caused O
difficulties O
with O
the O
old O
indigenous O
population O
. O

A O
" O
sentimental O
restraint O
" O
on O
old O
traditions O
and O
customs O
expressed O
how O
incapable O
the O
displaced O
were O
to O
forget O
the O
old O
homeland O
. O

In O
all O
the O
narratives O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
social O
harmony O
has O
been O
guiding O
for O
action O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
creation O
of O
a O
new O
sense O
of O
community O
should O
compensate O
for O
the O
loss O
most O
often O
experienced O
as O
cruel O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
such O
typical O
difficulties O
, O
a O
strength O
of O
the O
book O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
experiences O
of O
the O
different O
generations O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
plausible O
that O
the O
generation O
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sixties O
and O
seventies O
wanted O
to O
have O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
past O
of O
their O
parents O
who O
had O
been O
expelled O
. O

A O
consciousness O
of O
the O
" O
lost O
homeland O
" O
existed O
; O
however O
, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
sentimentally O
occupied O
. O

This O
changed O
only O
again O
in O
the O
eighties O
, O
when O
in O
Germany B-LOC
a O
renaissance O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
home O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
reference O
to O
the O
former O
German B-MISC
settlements O
again O
. O

Lehmann B-PER
will O
not O
be O
tired O
in O
describing O
and O
reproducing O
the O
stories O
of O
displaced O
persons O
, O
repeatedly O
pointing O
out O
that O
, O
despite O
radical O
prejudices O
, O
they O
do O
not O
relate O
to O
revanchism O
. O

One O
may O
believe O
the O
author O
, O
who O
understands O
his O
book O
as O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
different O
nations O
, O
when O
he O
calls O
in O
this O
sense O
to O
understand O
the O
old O
homeland O
only O
as O
a O
" O
homeland O
in O
the O
head O
" O
. O

But O
despite O
this O
certainly O
lazy O
attitude O
and O
programming O
, O
the O
many O
reports O
and O
narratives O
leave O
a O
false O
aftertaste O
, O
which O
is O
primarily O
due O
to O
the O
methodology O
of O
German B-MISC
folklore O
. O

History O
, O
as O
written O
in O
this O
book O
, O
is O
reproduced O
primarily O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

The O
one O
story O
breaks O
down O
into O
many O
stories O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
be O
scientifically O
classified O
exactly O
according O
to O
different O
genres O
. O

For O
example O
, O
success O
stories O
, O
weaknesses O
and O
overwhelming O
stories O
are O
typical O
forms O
of O
telling O
a O
particular O
group O
who O
still O
want O
to O
forget O
their O
initial O
difficulties O
in O
the O
new O
homeland O
. O

An O
overwhelming O
form O
of O
storytelling O
is O
to O
be O
found O
, O
in O
contrast O
, O
among O
women O
who O
have O
become O
victims O
of O
rape O
. O

However O
, O
this O
scientifically O
derived O
classification O
of O
narrative O
types O
remains O
only O
external O
. O

The O
narratives O
themselves O
are O
central O
in O
the O
present O
form O
of O
presentation O
; O
a O
reflection O
on O
them O
and O
thus O
a O
possibility O
of O
evaluation O
and O
arrangement O
remains O
out O
. O

This O
circumstance O
, O
however O
, O
leads O
all O
too O
easily O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
compassionate O
comprehension O
or O
sympathetic O
identification O
with O
the O
affected O
people O
forget O
those O
constellations O
of O
history O
, O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
which O
the O
fraglos O
cruel O
individual O
events O
should O
, O
however O
, O
necessarily O
be O
presented O
. O

Thus O
it O
seems O
quite O
irritating O
, O
for O
example O
, O
when O
it O
is O
reported O
about O
the O
" O
double O
luck O
" O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
from O
Siebenbürgen B-LOC
, O
who O
as O
a O
People B-MISC
's I-MISC
German I-MISC
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
join O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
but O
had O
to O
join O
the O
Waffen B-ORG
- I-ORG
SS I-ORG
; O
who O
was O
thus O
able O
to O
save O
himself O
over O
the O
years O
of O
war O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
remained O
free O
from O
the O
prison O
of O
war O
. O

Leading O
the O
luck O
of O
an O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
in O
front O
of O
your O
eyes O
, O
is O
the O
one O
side O
. O

The O
other O
must O
be O
to O
arrange O
the O
individual O
episodes O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
the O
years O
thereafter O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
an O
objective O
perspective O
can O
be O
taken O
. O

It O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
assume O
that O
merely O
reproducing O
authentic O
reports O
necessarily O
leads O
to O
an O
appropriate O
view O
of O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
carries O
the O
danger O
of O
a O
look O
at O
history O
that O
styles O
all O
those O
involved O
to O
their O
victims O
. O

It O
is O
undoubtedly O
necessary O
to O
also O
deal O
with O
the O
victims O
of O
history O
who O
stood O
on O
the O
perpetrator O
's O
side O
. O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
however O
, O
it O
should O
be O
wisely O
avoided O
to O
suggest O
a O
relativeization O
of O
history O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
confuse O
all O
differences O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
" O
comprehensible O
understanding O
. O
" O

In O
this O
context O
, O
it O
is O
also O
not O
enough O
to O
issue O
programmatic O
slogans O
for O
the O
" O
reconciliation O
of O
all O
cultures O
" O
. O

Rather O
, O
this O
leads O
to O
other O
fundamental O
misunderstandings O
that O
help O
to O
obscure O
crucial O
differences O
. O

This O
confusion O
is O
most O
evident O
at O
Lehmann B-PER
's O
place O
, O
where O
he O
advocates O
a O
" O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
" O
and O
declares O
this O
as O
a O
perspective O
that O
should O
arise O
from O
a O
non O
- O
revanchistic O
immigrant O
perspective O
, O
so O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
solution O
of O
the O
immigrant O
problem O
becomes O
an O
example O
for O
those O
questions O
and O
problems O
that O
arise O
as O
a O
result O
of O
immigration O
movements O
: O

" O
The O
theme O
of O
this O
book O
remains O
current O
: O

The O
question O
, O
how O
individuals O
and O
families O
with O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
in O
our O
country O
find O
a O
new O
home O
, O
in O
which O
memories O
they O
carry O
the O
old O
home O
and O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
region O
of O
origin O
and O
tradition O
, O
how O
they O
maintain O
contact O
with O
the O
first O
home O
. O
" O

In O
the O
equation O
here O
made O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
immigrants O
and O
asylum O
seekers O
as O
well O
as O
their O
respective O
experiences O
of O
foreignness O
, O
the O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
these O
groups O
is O
brought O
to O
the O
table O
. O

After O
all O
, O
a O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
consists O
of O
the O
coexistence O
of O
the O
most O
diverse O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
who O
have O
forcibly O
or O
deliberately O
moved O
to O
Germany B-LOC
or O
other O
countries O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

The O
foreign O
experience O
of O
these O
groups O
, O
however O
, O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
fundamentally O
different O
from O
that O
of O
the O
settlers O
of O
the O
1940s O
or O
that O
of O
their O
children O
decades O
later O
. O

The O
latter O
have O
proven O
to O
identify O
with O
Germany B-LOC
despite O
the O
losses O
of O
the O
" O
old O
homeland O

east O
, O
" O
have O
built O
up O
a O
national O
consciousness O
due O
to O
their O
ethnic O
affiliation O
. O

Such O
identification O
is O
neither O
possible O
nor O
desirable O
for O
immigrants O
. O

While O
for O
immigrants O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
homogeneous O
nation O
state O
was O
decisive O
, O
for O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
immigrants O
today O
it O
is O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
nation O
state O
. O

A O
focus O
on O
subjective O
feelings O
, O
as O
is O
done O

she O
was O

But O
, O
after O
the O

of O
Mirjam B-PER

she O
felt O

Andrea B-PER
started O
to O

more O

It O
was O
no O

Suddenly O
she O

of O
food O
in O
her O

And O
at O
some O
point O
the O

Andrea B-PER
had O
become O
addicted O

addicted O
to O
the O

Hunger O
was O
foreign O
to O

her O
whole O

was O
foreign O
to O
her O
at O
once O
. O

That O
she O
was O
sick O
, O
she O
did O

know O
at O
the O
time O

Only O
when O
she O
read O
a O
diet O
book O
one O
day O
, O
she O
noticed O
it O
. O

A O
devout O
woman O
was O
described O
- O
and O
in O
this O
story O
Andrea B-PER
recognized O
herself O
again O
. O

At O
that O
moment O
it O
was O
clear O
to O
her O
that O
she O
had O
to O
do O
something O
about O
her O
suffering O
. O

So O
Andrea B-PER
took O
the O
initiative O
and O
applied O
to O
a O
clinic O
for O
addicts O
in O
Allgäu B-LOC
. O

A O
few O
weeks O
later O
, O
she O
left O
her O
husband O
and O
children O
for O
three O
months O
of O
therapy O
. O

The O
relatives O
warned O
her O
to O
be O
a O
rhinoceros O
mother O
. O

For O
Andrea B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
: O

" O
I O
can O
only O
be O
a O
good O
mother O
if O
I O
'm O
doing O
well O
for O
myself O
. O
" O

When O
Andrea B-PER
presented O
herself O
on O
the O
first O
day O
in O
the O
group O
, O
she O
said O
: O

" O
My O
name O

Andrea B-PER

eat O
too O
much O
, O
but O
otherwise O
have O
no O

" O

Everyone O
laughed O
, O
and O
soon O
she O
also O
knew O
why O
. O
" O

I O
had O
suppressed O
my O
problems O
until O
the O
therapy O
. O
" O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
Andrea B-PER
was O
not O

satisfied O

her O
existence O
as O
a O
young O

Against O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
: O

An O
incitement O
to O
unrest O
in O
the O
Elven O
Tower O

The O
sociology O
does O
not O
without O
reason O
draw O
the O
suspicion O
of O
the O
high O
stakes O
on O
itself O
. O

Because O
it O
claims O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
whole O
of O
society O
as O
its O
specific O
subject O
area O
. O

What O
a O
miracle O
that O
the O
society O
that O
was O
so O
targeted O
reacted O
with O
mistrust O
to O
the O
acquisition O
by O
sociology O
. O

Until O
the O
Adenauer O
period O
, O
the O
publicly O
respected O
lady O
society O
felt O
most O
embarrassed O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
becoming O
third O
sociology O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
the O
turbulent O
political O
times O
of O
the O
late O
sixties O
that O
she O
succumbed O
to O
her O
stormy O
pressures O
. O

Encouragingly O
, O
the O
society B-ORG
of I-ORG
sociology I-ORG
fell O
into O
the O
arms O
. O

This O
yes O
- O
word O
has O
led O
to O
a O
covenant O
for O
life O
, O
but O
it O
has O
become O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
incessant O
love O
relationship O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
which O
the O
expectation O
of O
this O
young O
social O
science O
at O
the O
peak O
of O
its O
academic O
spread O
was O
sustained O
. O

The O
conviction O
that O
one O
associated O
with O
that O
sophisticated O
goal O
of O
knowledge O
was O
to O
formulate O
a O
theory O
of O
society O
as O
a O
whole O
that O
should O
be O
both O
critical O
and O
practically O
transformative O
. O

Are O
we O
, O
therefore O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
process O
in O
which O
the O
utopian O
energies O
have O
completely O
revived O
, O
which O
had O
been O
invested O
in O
the O
massive O
undertaking O
of O
a O
revolution O
of O
all O
outdated O
working O
and O
living O
conditions O
to O
be O
effected O
by O
enlightenment O
and O
criticism O
? O

If O
asked O
differently O
: O

How O
can O
we O
regain O
the O
attraction O
of O
sociology O
as O
a O
changeling O
force O
in O
reality O
, O
which O
interrupted O
it O
in O
the O
course O
of O
its O
" O
maturation O
process O
" O
to O
normal O
science O
? O

For O
the O
utopian O
loss O
of O
sociology O
there O
are O
three O
main O
reasons O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
the O
utopia O
itself O
that O
has O
become O
modest O
from O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
great O
visionary O
promises O
pushed O
forward O
historically O
until O
recently O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
increasingly O
concrete O
utopian O
challenge O
has O
arisen O
through O
the O
simple O
list O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
utopian O
ideals O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
historical O
situation O
has O
assumed O
a O
gravity O
that O
allows O
any O
longing O
projection O
of O
a O
completely O
different O
one O
in O
the O
forthcoming O
morning O
merely O
as O
an O
apocalypse O
. O

The O
desire O
images O
at O
the O
origin O
of O
modernity O
have O
been O
reshaped O
in O
the O
critical O
tradition O
of O
social O
teaching O
to O
the O
concrete O
utopia O
of O
the O
real O
history O
of O
progressive O
bourgeois O
emancipation O
. O

The O
stage O
leads O
from O
the O
fictional O
future O
paintings O
of O
a O
Morus B-PER
, O
Campanella B-PER
and O
Bacon B-PER
to O
the O
technical O
and O
early O
socialist O
utopianism O
of O
an O
Owen B-PER
, O
Saint B-PER
- I-PER
Simon I-PER
, O
Fourier B-PER
and O
Proudhon B-PER
. O

Marx B-PER
polemized O
against O
these O
utopian O
socialists O
with O
all O
sharpness O
, O
who O
warned O
them O
to O
be O
mere O
dreamers O
. O

He O
himself O
, O
like O
so O
many O
, O
puts O
the O
utopia O
from O
the O
head O
to O
the O
feet O
and O
comes O
to O
the O
matter O
materialistically O
: O

In O
Communism O
utopia O
and O
reality O
merge O
, O
namely O
as O
the O
society O
of O
free O
producers O
, O
as O
material O
abundance O
and O
as O
social O
relations O
transparent O
for O
all O
members O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
this O
concreteization O
of O
utopia O
has O
not O
led O
to O
the O
paradise O
promised O
. O

For O
, O
as O
we O
read O
in O
Horkheimer B-LOC
's I-LOC
diary O
note O
from O
the O

, O
the O

Rather O
, O
they O

in O
the O

, O
the O

of O
the O

The O
shock O
of O
those O

, O
such O
as O
the O
reactor O
accidents O
that O
endanger O
the O
survival O
of O
the O
species O
, O
has O
brought O
sociology O
out O
of O
the O
sleep O
of O
dawn O
of O
progress O
. O

This O
awakening O
finds O
its O
current O
expression O
in O
the O
burning O
term O
of O
the O
" O

society O
" O
, O
whose O
secret O

consists O
in O
making O
the O

still O

according O

This O
hope O
of O
a O
" O
reflexive O
modernisation O
" O
by O
Ulrich B-PER
Beck I-PER
is O
by O
no O
means O
new O
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
foreseeable O
catastrophe O
, O
already O
leading O
sociologists O
of O
the O
Weimar B-MISC
era I-MISC
such O
as O
Max B-PER
Weber I-PER
and O
Karl B-PER
Mannheim I-PER
argued O
that O
the O
reality O
was O
closer O
to O
the O
concrete O
Utopian O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
: O

The O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
democratic O
self O
- O
determination O
and O
material O
welfare O
are O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
enchanted O
form O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
that O
utopia O
that O
has O
long O
been O
brought O
from O
heaven O
to O
earth O
: O

Everyone O
produces O
according O
to O
his O
abilities O
, O
everyone O
consumes O
according O
to O
his O

. O

This O
secularized O
ideal O
of O
the O
right O
of O
all O
to O
everything O
, O
however O
, O
is O
currently O
being O
overlooked O

by O
a O

This O
formula O
, O
with O
which O
the O

Claus B-PER
Offe I-PER
entered O
the O
exit O
from O
such O
almost O
objective O
processes O
as O
automotive O

agricultural O
chemistry O
, O

etc O
. O

To O
make O

, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
residual O
hope O
to O
avoid O
the O
continuing O
disaster O
resulting O
from O
a O
generalization O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
" O
free O

for O
free O
citizens O
" O
through O
inconvenience O
and O
stagnation O
. O

Does O
this O
utopia O
of O
voluntary O
on O
- O
the O
- O
ground O
walking O
not O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
succumbing O
to O
the O
temptation O
of O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
the O
contemporary O
? O

By O
relaxing O
the O
critical O
power O
of O
utopian O
thought O
in O
enlightenment O
science O
, O
the O
dimension O
of O
historical O
sense O
- O
making O
in O
the O
horizon O
of O
historical O
objective O
perspectives O
is O
diminished O
in O
the O
social O
self O
- O
thematization O
. O

This O
vacuum O
is O
not O
only O
a O
breeding O
ground O
for O
ideologies O
such O
as O
the O
posthistoric O
one O
, O
but O
this O
utopianism O
also O
promotes O
the O
fixation O
on O
alternative O
programs O
such O
as O
fundamentalism O
, O
regionalism O
, O
and O
feminism O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
unspoken O
in O
utopian O
thinking O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lack O
of O
that O
utopian O
forward O
- O
thinking O
that O
strikes O
the O
spark O
that O
can O
light O
the O
light O
that O
accompanies O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
better O
society O
. O

Contrary O
to O
the O
risks O
of O
a O
risk O
society O
, O
a O
disciplined O
, O
organized O
scientific O
enterprise O
is O
objectively O
overwhelmed O
. O

For O
the O
growing O
destructive O
potentials O
in O
nature O
and O
society O
generated O
by O
the O
individual O
sciences O
themselves O
have O
their O
reason O
not O
least O
also O
in O
that O
the O
subjects O
are O
merely O
navel O
- O
gazing O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
remain O
in O
their O
ivory O
towers O
. O

In O
this O
compulsory O
multi O
- O
disciplinary O
cooperation O
between O
the O
natural O
sciences O
, O
the O
humanities O
and O
the O
social O
sciences O
, O
science O
assumes O
a O
special O
responsibility O
from O
society O
due O
to O
its O
object O
- O
relatedness O
to O
the O
totality O
of O
social O
science O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
sociology O
has O
the O
self O
- O
critical O
task O
of O
returning O
to O
its O
own O
home O
and O
acting O
contagious O
through O
this O
exemplaryness O
. O

Only O
as O
a O
" O
house O
of O
open O
doors O
" O
with O
internal O
plurality O
it O
allows O
a O
process O
of O
combining O
diverse O
methods O
and O
theories O
. O

The O
cognitive O
identity O
of O
sociology O
is O
not O
in O
any O
way O
jeopardized O
by O
this O
openness O
, O
as O
the O
discipline O
has O
stabilized O
organizationally O
and O
its O
academic O
reputation O
seems O
to O
be O
secured O
. O

Its O
status O
as O
a O
science O
of O
interpretation O
requires O
the O
practice O
of O
extreme O
tolerance O
towards O
competing O
paradigms O
, O
different O
methodical O
approaches O
and O
the O
divergent O
interpretation O
of O
social O
facts O
. O

Because O
social O
analyses O
can O
not O
operate O
with O
an O
objectiveistic O
claim O
to O
knowledge O
. O

Rather O
, O
societal O
theory O
is O
convinced O
by O
the O
formation O
of O
argumentation O
, O
that O
is O
, O
by O
empirical O
acuity O
and O
interpretative O
plausibility O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
future O
of O
sociology O
lies O
in O
establishing O
a O
unity O
of O
originally O
divergent O
traditions O
: O

the O
empirical O
method O
of O
knowledge O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
humanistic O
hermeneutics O
on O
the O
other O
. O

This O
principle O
of O
tolerance O
at O
home O
implies O
, O
moreover O
, O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
same O
street O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
strict O
cooperation O
of O
sociology O
with O
other O
social O
sciences O
, O
if O
it O
does O
not O
wish O
to O
give O
up O
its O
great O
aim O
of O
knowledge O
, O
which O
Horkheimer O
believes O
consists O
in O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
historical O
course O
of O
the O
epoch O
. O

This O
gigantic O
research O
program O
is O
only O
feasible O
if O
sociology O
becomes O
the O
carrier O
of O
a O
communication O
between O
the O
fields O
of O
history O
, O
economics O
, O
anthropology O
, O
ethnology O
and O
psychology O
, O
among O
others O
, O
which O
jointly O
engage O
in O
a O
philosophical O
fundamental O
reflection O
, O
are O
ready O
for O
a O
continuous O
exchange O
of O
individual O
scientific O
advances O
and O
link O
the O
empirical O
research O
efforts O
systematically O
with O
theory O
formation O
. O

This O
orientation O
of O
the O
social O
sciences O
towards O
a O
historically O
and O
empirically O
sustained O
theory O
of O
social O
science O
to O
be O
developed O
through O
research O
cooperation O
is O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

A O
second O
must O
follow O
. O

For O
the O
increasingly O
specialized O
social O
sciences O
the O
subject O
of O
their O
research O
efforts O
breaks O
down O
not O
only O
between O
the O
fingers O
, O
but O
the O
meaning O
of O
their O
teaching O
and O
research O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
workload O
of O
the O
shoemaker O
, O
who O
stays O
at O
his O
leash O
, O
may O
the O
water O
even O
stand O
to O
his O
neck O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
future O
perspective O
of O
the O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
lies O
in O
the O
emerging O
coalition O
of O
the O
humanities O
. O

According O
to O
the O
American B-MISC
historian O
Robert B-PER
Darnton I-PER
, O
a O
novel O
faculty O
configuration O
, O
which O
in O
consequence O
includes O
a O
dissolution O
of O
traditional O
faculties O
and O
departments O
, O
leads O
to O
an O
innovation O
spurt O
: O

The O
one O
- O
dimensionality O
of O
cause O
and O
event O
research O
is O
overcome O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
realistic O
understanding O
of O
the O
symbolic O
cultural O
system O
as O
the O
common O
reference O
point O
of O
the O
humanities O
. O

Let O
us O
take O
together O
: O

Sociology O
must O
firstly O
recognize O
the O
status O
of O
an O
empirical O
, O
comprehensible O
and O
critical O
social O
science O
, O
not O
only O
for O
itself O
, O
but O
also O
to O
exploit O
its O
character O
as O
a O
multi O
- O
paradigm O
science O
productively O
for O
itself O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
project O
requires O
a O
restructured O
societal O
theory O
of O
interdisciplinary O
cooperation O
among O
the O
various O
social O
sciences O
. O

Finally O
, O
thirdly O
, O
the O
science O
of O
society O
, O
due O
to O
its O
perspective O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
human O
life O
, O
is O
best O
suited O
to O
demonstrate O
a O
general O
interest O
of O
humanity O
in O
the O
dangerous O
work O
of O
the O
self O
- O
perpetuating O
sorcerer O
teachers O
of O
the O
technical O
- O
scientific O
civilization O
, O
the O
independent O
individual O
sciences O
with O
their O
particularistic O
rationalities O
. O

The O
present O
task O
of O
sociology O
is O
to O
bring O
the O
sciences O
, O
whose O
differentiation O
is O
irreversible O
, O
to O
the O
common O
denominator O
of O
a O
multi O
- O
disciplinary O
discourse O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
solve O
a O
binding O
question O
for O
all O
: O

how O
to O
prevent O
the O
disaster O
. O

The O
processing O
of O
this O
existential O
question O
certainly O
does O
not O
succeed O
as O
the O
genius O
of O
a O
researcher O
or O
a O
discipline O
, O
but O
is O
only O
conceivable O
as O
a O
joint O
work O
of O
all O
sciences O
. O

In O
view O
of O
this O
, O
the O
science O
of O
enlightenment O
is O
quite O
the O
protagonist O
of O
a O
utopian O
program O
: O

the O
overcoming O
of O
discipline O
boundaries O
. O

The O
indifference O
of O
university O
sciences O
to O
each O
other O
is O
scientifically O
irresponsible O
in O
view O
of O
the O
world O
's O
dangers O
and O
their O
complex O
interdependencies O
and O
is O
as O
outdated O
as O
the O
idea O
of O
unity O
science O
. O

The O
melody O
" O
If O
everyone O
does O
his O
own O
, O
the O
whole O
thing O
will O
already O
succeed O
" O
is O
an O
extremely O
dangerous O
punchline O
. O

From O
the O
sleep O
of O
reason O
awakens O
an O
" O
interdisciplinarity O
from O
below O
" O
, O
which O
Jürgen B-PER

The O

the O

which O
, O

A O
common O
characteristic O
of O
these O
three O

beetles O
is O
that O
the O
eagle O
is O
depicted O
with O
a O
peacock O
crown O
made O
of O
extended O
wings O
. O

This O
mixture O
of O
eagle O
and O
peacock O
is O
based O
on O
a O
deeply O
Christian O
meaning O
: O

The O
eagle O
symbolizes O
the O
resurrection O
and O
ascension O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
the O
dove O
eternal O
life O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
this O

bird O
was O

regarded O
as O
an O
imperial O
symbol O
of O
sovereignty O
and O
a O
predecessor O
of O
the O
Prussian O
Reichsadler B-MISC
is O
also O
an O
indication O

temporal O
arrangement O
. O

His O
body O
form O
in O
frontal O
view O

only O
the O
head O
in O
profile O
, O
obviously O
goes O
back O
to O

art O

the O
10th O
century O
. O

Stylistically O
considered O
, O
the O
most O
beautiful O
and O

" O
of O

by O
whom O

made O
, O
can O
only O
be O
presumed O
. O

Some O
of O
it O
refers O
to O
Byzantine B-MISC

who O
may O
have O

Therefore O
, O
one O

not O

to O
wonder O
that O
these O

This O

the O

of O
romantic O
A O

singing O
, O
i.e. O
unseen O
pieces O
for O
choir O

of O

A O
program O
with O
music O
by O
Johann B-PER
Sebastian I-PER
Bach I-PER
is O
planned O
for O
the O
Advent O
. O

These O
concerts O
can O
cost O
the O

a O
lot O
: O

Posters O
are O
glued O
to O
the O

strongly O

" O

Many O
have O
so O
much O
fun O
playing O
with O
the O
choir O
that O
they O
also O
like O
to O
perform O
as O
soloists O
once O
. O
" O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
Kantorin O
has O
her O
own O
string O
orchestra O
is O
unusual O
. O

To O
church O
concerts O
usually O
the O
musicians O
are O
bought O
together O
, O
which O
you O
just O
need O
. O

Or O
you O
can O
hire O
a O
whole O
professional O
orchestra O
at O
once O
. O

This O
is O
expensive O
and O
guarantees O
not O
a O
good O
concert O
for O
a O
long O
time O
yet O
. O
" O

The O
orchestra O
tastes O
just O
as O
well O
as O
the O

The O
relationships O
are O
thus O
much O
closer O

and O
the O
musicians O
motivate O
each O
other O
at O
concerts O

" O

That O
very O
heavy O
romantic O
pieces O
, O
such O
as O
the O
German B-MISC
Requiem O
by O
Brahms B-PER

with O
the O
mainly O
lay O
orchestra O
are O
hardly O
to O

Elke B-PER
Mattmüller I-PER
likes O
to O

To O
Johann B-PER
Sebastian I-PER
Bach I-PER
the O
Kantorin B-MISC
has O
a O
split O
relationship O
, O
despite O
the O
concerts O

20th O
and O
December O
6th O
, O
where O
mainly O
works O

at O

how O

Also O
for O

Anton B-PER

Your O

In O
the O

I O
do O

the O

But O
everyone O
should O
be O
open O

it O

demands O
. O

As O
the O
head O
of O
the O
conference O
, O
Professor O
Joachim B-PER
Wolfram I-PER
Dudenhausen I-PER
from O
the O
Rudolf B-ORG
Virchow I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
of O
the O
Freie B-ORG
Universität I-ORG
Berlin I-ORG
, O
explained O
, O
the O
in O
principle O
harmless O
, O
but O
costly O
test O
, O
if O
it O
provides O
clues O
to O
genetic O
damage O
such O
as O
neural O
tube O
defects O
or O
for O
trisomies O
( O
such O
as O
the O
former O
Mongolism B-MISC
called O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
) O
, O
further O
extensive O
and O
for O
the O
woman O
and O
the O
unborn O
not O
entirely O
harmless O
examinations O
after O
themselves O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
amniocentesis O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
interventions O
, O
according O
to O
the O
consultants O
, O
are O
unnecessary O
and O
should O
be O
avoided O
for O
pregnant O
women O
. O

As O
the O
triple O
diagnosis O
is O
handled O
today O
, O
it O
too O
often O
provides O
clues O
to O
a O
genetic O
risk O
that O
can O
not O
be O
confirmed O
with O
the O
amniocentesis O
. O

These O
shortcomings O
, O
according O
to O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
, O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
laboratory O
regulations O
, O
with O
which O
biochemically O
three O
childhood O
substances O
are O
measured O
in O
the O
mother O
's O
blood O
( O
Alpha O
- O
Fetoprotein O
, O
Choriongonadotropine O
and O
Östriol O
) O
. O

Often O
, O
the O
test O
's O
testability O
is O
impaired O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
on O
the O
medical O
side O
, O
the O
exact O
age O
of O
the O
unborn O
is O
often O
not O
determined O
before O
the O
blood O
is O
taken O
and O
the O
blood O
values O
when O
the O
child O
is O
older O
than O
suspected O
do O
not O
reflect O
an O
existing O
risk O
. O

The O
experts O
therefore O
require O
that O
the O
test O
be O
performed O
only O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
age O
determination O
of O
the O
fete O
by O
means O
of O
ultrasound O
. O

As O
Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
added O
, O
further O
consultation O
of O
pregnant O
women O
is O
also O
essential O
. O

It O
should O
be O
made O
clear O
to O
the O
future O
mothers O
that O
the O
test O
, O
for O
example O
, O
can O
only O
detect O
a O
Down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
in O
six O
out O
of O
ten O
cases O
and O
generally O
only O
a O
small O
part O
of O
all O
possible O
inheritance O
damage O
is O
detected O
. O

Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
: O

" O
We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
warranty O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
healthy O
child O
. O
" O

The O
feasibility O
of O
the O
test O
under O
accompanying O
advice O
and O
ultrasound O
control O
had O
to O
be O
determined O
first O
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
, O
several O
series O
of O
tests O
are O
conducted O
at O
German B-MISC
clinics O
, O
such O
as O
at O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Göttingen I-ORG
, O
where O
so O
far O
more O
than O
10,000 O
mothers O
are O
being O
tested O
. O

For O
concern O
regarding O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
abortion O
, O
the O
consultants O
also O
consider O
that O
the O
test O
is O
only O
applicable O
relatively O
late O
, O
between O
the O
15th O
and O
18th O
weeks O
of O
pregnancy O
. O

Here O
they O
hope O
that O
the O
new O
development O
of O
a O
blood O
test O
, O
in O
which O
the O
placenta O
proteins O
will O
be O
examined O
, O
will O
bring O
a O
change B-MISC
for O
the O
better O
. O

However O
, O
this O
test O
is O
not O
yet O
practical O

In O
doing O

, O
the O

came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O

was O

are O
called O
in O
the O
flying O
language O
, O
were O
initially O
also O
raised O
by O
the O

. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
it O
was O
the O
rule O
that O
two O
- O
engine O
aircraft O
had O
to O
set O
up O
their O
routes O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
, O
in O
the O

, O
they O
could O
reach O
the O
next O

within O
60 O
minutes O
at O
the O

. O

This O
meant O
that O
routes O
such O
as O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
route I-MISC
were O
initially O
largely O
closed O
to O
two O
- O
stroke O
jets O
such O
as O
the O
Airbusse B-MISC
or O
the O
Boeing-767 B-MISC
: O

The O
necessary O
routes O
over O
Greenland B-LOC

Newfoundland O
cost O
additional O
flight O
time O
and O
made O
economic O
flight O
operations O
impossible O
. O

Under O
pressure O
from O
manufacturers O
and O
airlines O
, O
who O
promised O
economic O
benefits O
from O
the O
cost O
- O
effective O
use O
of O
long O
- O

twin O

, O
these O
provisions O

the O
" O
Extended O

give O

the O
possibility O

the O

to O

, O
the O

developed O
a O

on O
this O

the O
mid O

by O

In O

" O

" O

Meanwhile O

a O
significantly O

Such O
an O

can O
be O

says O
Boeing B-ORG
, O
the O
need O
for O
an O

has O
arisen O

Under O
the O
rubric O
, O
the O

has O
to O
inform O

, O
the O

only O

Statistically O
speaking O
, O
you O
can O
fly O

for O
almost O
11,000 O

without O

, O
a O

And O
statistically O
, O
even O
20,000 O

go O
by O
until O

over O
the O
North B-MISC

Beyond O
these O
numbers O
games O
, O
however O
, O
it O
also O
remains O
true O
that O
the O
passengers O

An O
old O
Frankfurt B-MISC
question O
about O
this O
sculpture O
by O
the O
Belgian O
sculptor O
Constantin B-PER
Meunier I-PER
( O
1831 O
- O
1905 O
) O
is O
as O
follows O
: O

" O
What O
does O
he O
actually O
imagine O
? O

The O
right O
leg O
of O
course O
! O
" O

And O
what O
else O
? O

The O
" O
Debardeur O
" O
( O
dock O
worker O
) O
, O
as O
the O
figure O
created O
in O
1883 O
is O
called O
, O
stands O
with O
both O
legs O
in O
a O
crisis O
of O
art O
, O
to O
whose O
authenticity O
and O
social O
claim O
artists O
like O
Meunier B-PER
or O
his O
far O
more O
famous O
companion O
van B-PER
Gogh I-PER
have O
walked O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
nuts O
of O
youth O
, O
the O
rigid O
ideals O
of O
neo O
- O
classicism O
and O
the O
salon O
life O
of O
Bohème O
seemed O
inadequate O
to O
the O
human O
reality O
they O
experienced O
, O
to O
the O
lies O
. O

Meunier B-PER
's I-PER
response O
to O
this O
was O
the O
radical O
aversion O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
, O
to O
the O
modeling O
of O
workers O
' O
figures O
. O

In O
this O
he O
was O
not O
concerned O
with O
the O
depiction O
of O
the O
misery O
in O
which O
the O
proletariat O
had O
fallen O
through O
the O
then O
still O
not O
socially O
acceptable O
industrialization O
. O

He O
created O
realistic O
workers O
figures O
that O
embody O
unbroken O
strength O
, O
pride O
and O
dignity O
with O
a O
certain O
pathos O
. O

Apollo B-PER
as O
a O
prophet O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
naturalism O
with O
a O
touch O
of O
classical O
antiquity O
. O

Such O
sculpture O
clearly O
took O
party O
to O
the O
emerging O
working O
class O
movement O
and O
fell O
into O
a O
destructive O
, O
risky O
contradiction O
to O
the O
contemporary O
art O
view O
. O

Meunier B-PER
was O
wrongly O
accused O
of O
equating O
his O
heroes O
of O
work O
with O
admittedly O
similar O
standpoints O
of O
Nazi B-MISC
times I-MISC
or O

Schmidt B-PER
, O

" O

The O

everything O
even O

That O
is O
why O
Yvonne B-PER

Our O

that O
the O

that O

no O

so O
dusty O

there O
was O
no O

any O

It O
says O
that O
with O
the O
sewage O
treatment O
plant O
is O
only O
a O
rumor O
, O
and O
the O
wastewater O
is O
now O
only O
directed O
to O
the O
neighbouring O
bay O
, O
where O
the O
fishing O
village O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
lies O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
go O
there O
anyway O
to O

anymore O
, O
the O
fish O
tastes O
more O
fader O
at O
last O
, O
and O
the O
waiters O
became O
more O
and O
more O
unfriendly O
and O
once O
even O
really O
disgusting O
, O
when O
Heinz B-PER
got O
goat O
- O
meat O
- O
sweeping O
languste O
and O
just O
wanted O
to O
pay O
accordingly O
. O

This O
time O
we O
have O
often O
been O
in O
" O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
" O
, O
the O
northern O
pebble O
of O
our O
bay O
, O
which O
they O
have O
only O
now O
built O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
cute O
, O
small O
bungalow O
village O
with O
diving O
school O
, O
disco O
, O
two O
restaurants O
and O
a O
shopping O
center O
. O

Earlier O
there O
stood O
some O
shameful O
barracks O
, O
which O
they O
, O
together O
with O
a O
forest O
and O
some O
rocks O
that O
were O
in O
the O
way O
, O
threw O
away O
and O
then O
kicked O
the O
whole O
rock O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
into O
the O
sea O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
these O
nervous O
, O
ugly O
seabirds O
that O
used O
to O
nest O
there O
have O
also O
disappeared O
. O

Apparently O
they O
should O
be O
very O
rare O
, O
but O
last O
year O
there O
were O
still O
enough O
of O
them O
to O
bring O
me O
to O
sleep O
with O
their O
circle O
three O
nights O
in O
a O
row O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
they O
have O
enclosed O
the O
whole O
bay O
around O
the O
" O
Plaza B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
, O
so O
that O
now O
this O
whole O
bunch O
no O
longer O
comes O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
sell O
any O
kind O
of O
stuff O
or O
crouching O
. O

It O
had O
become O
more O
and O
more O
, O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
because O
unemployment O
in O
the O
region O
is O
supposed O
to O
lie O
at O
over O
40 O
percent O
. O

So O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
that O
. O

There O
is O
truly O
enough O
to O
do O
in O
our O
holiday O
bay O
, O
especially O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
too O
fine O
to O
learn O
a O
few O
words O

Although O
the O
security O
staff O
is O
already O
pretty O
large O
, O
I O
have O
read O
that O
they O
are O
still O
looking O
for O
people O
. O

Also O
with O
the O
faster O
way O
of O
creating O
the O
cans O
and O
bottles O
that O
lie O
around O
many O
places O
, O
you O
could O
employ O
some O
volunteers O
. O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
how O
linguistically O
impaired O
most O
locals O
are O
here O
! O

With O
the O
guy O
who O
used O
to O
run O
the O
bowling O
alley O
store O
, O
the O
understanding O
was O
so O
difficult O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
we O
had O
no O
desire O
to O
go O

No O
wonder O
that O
the O
guy O
made O
pleite O
! O

A O
loving O

the O

then O
quite O
cheaply O

now O
it O

Johann B-PER

took O
over O

Johann B-PER
paid O
little O
attention O

no O

a O

In O
short O
: O

From O
the O
modest O
estate O
became O
a O
water O
castle O
, O
which O
should O
withstand O
a O
conquest O

The O

The O

Although O

the O

you O

Although O

the O

However O
, O
in O

the O

There O
is O
a O

If O

it O
would O

It O
is O
just O
further O
mainly O
the O

This O
starts O
with O
the O

continues O
with O
the O

at O
an O
amazingly O
high O
level O

The O
driving O

is O
of O
beneficial O
kindness O
. O

It O
meets O
the O
needs O
of O
a O
solid O
everyday O
car O
ideally O
. O

The O
suspension O
proves O
to O
be O
quite O
stiff O
on O
certain O
short O
ground O
inflections O
, O
but O
without O
having O
to O
be O
classified O
as O

The O
entire O

is O
exemplary O
problem O

free O
, O
as O
you O
wish O

Of O

, O
the O

makes O
the O

At O

are O
also O
a O

even O

In O

this O

: O

Thanks O
to O

effort O
, O
the O
Carina B-MISC
engine I-MISC
with O
its O

, O
even O
only O

. O

Even O

can O
do O
this O

And O
this O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O

with O
this O
cultivated O

sufficiently O

In O

no O

What O

happened O
for O
the O
first O

this O

- O
is O
no O

a O
topic O
, O
according O
to O
data O
presented O
by O
Toyota B-ORG
today O
. O

The O
latest O
generation O
Magermix B-MISC
Carina I-MISC
not O
only O
meets O
the O
strict O
US B-MISC
standard I-MISC
, O
which O
covers O
speed O
peaks O
up O
to O
around O
90 O
km O

anyway O
, O
but O
also O
the O
new O
ECE B-MISC
exhaust I-MISC

, O
which O
up O
to O
120 O

requires O
safe O
compliance O
with O
US B-MISC
values I-MISC
and O
this O
over O
a O
runtime O
of O
80 O
000 O
kilometers O
. O

This O
gives O
rise O
to O
a O
new O
offer O
for O
the O
environmentally O
responsible O
car O
buyers O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
because O
the O
simple O
rule O
still O
applies O
, O
that O
every O
litre O
of O
fuel O
that O
is O
not O
burned O
is O
the O
best O
contribution O
to O
environmental O
protection O
. O

The O
modern O
diesel O
engine O
will O
undoubtedly O
receive O
a O
new O
competition O
with O
this O
Toyota B-MISC
concept I-MISC
for O
gasoline O
engines O
, O
because O
its O
previous O
consumption O
advantage O
shrinks O
at O
such O
consumption O
behaviour O
in O
the O
usual O
everyday O
traffic O
almost O
to O
zero O
. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
will O
certainly O
encourage O
diesel O
engineers O
to O
make O
new O
efforts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Toyota B-MISC
engineers I-MISC
must O
be O
certified O
: O

As O
consistently O
as O
it O
has O
been O
in O

, O
no O
one O
has O

the O

middle O

which O
no O

sees O
its O
future O
in O
the O
autocracy O

in O

In O

60 O

called O

so O
far O

for O
46 O

so O
answers O
from B-PER

simply O
: O

he O
stayed O
in O
various O

When O

Curiously O
: O

So O
bright O
the O
past O
of O
the O
city O
through O
Lersner B-PER
's I-PER
work O
stands O
before O
the O
eyes O
of O

, O
so O
dark O
is O
the O
knowledge O
about O

chronicler O
himself O
- O
at O
least O
until O
the O
time O
when O
he O
came O
back O
to O

That O
he O
spent O
his O
youth O
abroad O
, O
on O
which O
can O
only O
conclude O
a O
remark O
in O

chronicle O
: O

Dr. O
Eduard B-PER
Heyden I-PER
assumed O
in O

in O
a O
paper O
for O
the O
Frankfurt B-ORG

, O
Lersner B-PER

of O
that O
time O
accordingly O
, O
in O
France B-LOC
" O
to O
devote O
himself O
to O
legal O
studies O
. O

However O
, O
Lersner B-PER
was O
born O
into O
a O
Marburg B-MISC
and O
Kassel B-MISC
family O
of O
lawyers O
, O
who O
were O
nobled O
by O
Charles B-PER
V I-PER
in O

, O
received O
in O
1566 O
by O
the O
Patriziergesellschaft B-ORG
Alten I-ORG
- O
Limpurg O
and O
raised O
to O
the O
state O
of O
free O
reign O
about O
100 O
years O
later O
. O

At O
the O
age O
of O
34 O
, O
Lersner O
married O
Anna B-PER
Rosine I-PER
Steffan I-PER

- O
after O
her O
early O
death O
- O
1699 O
Anna B-PER
Sybilla I-PER

This O
second O
marriage O
led O
to O
long O
- O
standing O
conflicts O
with O
the O
Old B-PER
Limpurgers I-PER
, O
who O
had O
played O
a O
leading O
role O
in O
the O
city O
government O
since O
the O
15th O
century O
. O

In O
1715 O
he O
was O
elected O
to O
the O
city O
council O
- O
due O
to O
his O
" O
decisive O
abilities O
" O
. O

Three O
years O
later O
he O
also O
found O
a O
recording O
with O
the O
Old B-PER
Limpurgern I-PER
. O

In O
1721 O
Lersner B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O
a O
younger O
mayor O
. O

But O
in O
addition O
to O
all O
his O
office O
duties O
, O
he O
had O
time O
to O
diligently O
continue O
collecting O
materials O
for O
a O
second O
Chronicle O
Band O
. O

In O
1723 O
he O
became O
a O
clerk O
and O
held O
for O
three O
years O
- O
until O
his O
death O
on O
29 O
December O
1732 O
- O
the O
noble O
office O
of O
an O
elderly O
mayor O
. O

, O
its O
significance O
receives O
the O
name O

primarily O
through O

the O

These O
include O

for O

The O
component O
works O

Then O
it O
must O

The O

" O

We O
are O
an O
association O
of O
crazy O
people O
, O
" O
admits O
chairman O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
unapologetically O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
model O
builders O
place O
great O
value O
on O
a O
fine O
difference O
: O

In O
any O
case O
, O
they O
do O
not O
want O
to O
claim O
to O
pursue O
their O
leisure O
activities O
with O
bias O
. O

That O
would O
hardly O
be O
the O
right O
word O
to O
describe O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
bass O
players O
and O
craftsmen O
. O

When O
the O
men O
( O
whose O
domain O
the O
model O
building O
is O
still O
) O
enthusiastically O
tell O
of O
technical O
details O
, O
proudly O
perform O
their O
little O
miracles O
or O
follow O
the O
tracks O
of O
a O
model O
aircraft O
with O
the O
remote O
control O
in O
the O
hand O
banned O
, O
this O
has O
rather O
something O
delightfully O
creepy O
. O

Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
refers O
to O
Hanau B-MISC
's I-MISC
model O
builders O
as O
" O
individuals O
who O
have O
come O
together O
through O
a O
shared O
love O
of O
hobby O
" O
. O

Thirty O
young O
people O
also O
belong O
to O
the O
association O
, O
which O
has O
a O
total O
of O
about O
100 O
members O
. O

They O
are O
supervised O
by O
adults O
according O
to O
the O
individuality O
claim O
individually O
in O
the O
form O
of O
" O
smaller O
partnerships O
" O
while O
crafting O
. O

Two O
" O
groups O
" O
have O
formed O
in O
the O
model O
building O
club O
which O
has O
existed O
since O
1954 O
: O

the O
pilots O
and O
the O

. O

Cars O
, O
on O
the O

seem O
to O
be O
less O

a O

a O
childhood O

in O
this O

Joseph B-PER

Horst B-PER

And O

is O
also O
this O
: O

a O
" O
real O
" O
flight O
captain O
who O
wants O
to O
relax O
while O
model O
flying O
. O

On O
the O

he O
should O
find O
pretty O
much O
everything O
he O
knows O
of O
the O
large O
machines O
as O
important O
functions O
: O

Height O
, O
side O
, O
cross O
rudder O
, O

flaps O
or O
chassis O
for O

. O

With O
their O
fuel O
, O
however O
, O
a O
manned O
aircraft O
could O
not O
lift O
off O
. O

Very O
small O

fly O
with O

, O
larger O

with O
a O

. O

Unlike O
the O
ships O
, O
the O
model O
aircraft O
are O
not O
exactly O
scaled O
up O
. O
" O

In O
the O
reduction O
they O
would O
otherwise O
have O
too O
bad O
flight O
characteristics O
" O
, O
explains O
Pongratz B-PER
. O

Flying O
is O
a O
chapter O
in O
itself O
anyway O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
it O
is O
not O
without O
risk O
and O
requires O
a O
considerable O
degree O
of O
responsibility O
, O
on O
the O

Before O

a O

" O
Schmidt B-PER

out O

At O

the O

to O
the O
friendly O

Dr. O

from O
Moscow B-LOC

The O
story O
of O
the O
elderly O
woman O
Josefine B-PER
, O
who O
only O
late O
discovered O
her O
own O
needs O
and O
creativity O
, O
but O
who O
no O
longer O
wants O
to O
accept O
the O
roles O
assigned O
to O
her O
and O
finds O
herself O
through O
a O
" O
life O
against O
the O
line O
" O
, O
Alla B-PER
Rybikowa I-PER
considered O
" O
very O
important O
to O
make O
Russian B-MISC
society O
accessible O
" O
. O

" O
Women O
are O
emancipated O
in O
our O
country O
, O
for O
example O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
electoral O
rights O
, O
but O
from O
mid-30s O
they O
think O
life O
is O
over O
for O
them O
already O
, O
" O
said O
the O
translator O
and O
added O
: O

" O
Perhaps O
, O
because O
in O
socialist O
society O
already O
very O
early O
determined O
the O
life O
of O
the O
individual O
and O
the O
once O
made O
decision O
was O
then O
maintained O

" O

The O
story O
" O
When B-MISC
Grandma I-MISC
Josefine I-MISC
became I-MISC
" O
makes O
clear O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
that O
the O
man O
was O
never O
too O
old O
to O
start O
a O
new O
one O
. O

Obstructed O
self O
- O
realization O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
only O
a O
special O
Russian B-MISC
problem O
, O
as O
demonstrated O
by O
the O
reactions O
of O
the O
predominantly O
female O
middle O
- O
aged O
listeners O
from O
Spain B-LOC
and O
Germany B-LOC
during O
the O
bilingual O
reading O
. O

The O

’s O
lively O

harvested O
agreeable O
nodding O
, O
affirming O
yes O
calls O
and O
understanding O
smiles O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
writer O
Charlotte B-PER
Berz I-PER
, O
who O
was O
friends O
with O
Margot I-PER
Lang I-PER
, O
presented O
passages O
from O
the O
novel B-MISC

powerful O

understand O
the O

of O

The O

the O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
made O
an O
important O
contribution O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
by O
developing O
principles O
for O
the O
resettlement O

of O
displaced O
persons O

others O
affected O
and O
the O
environmental O
compatibility O
of O
such O
projects O
for O
projects O
financed B-MISC
by O
the O
World O

Similarly O
, O
the O
Government O
of O
India B-LOC
has O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
system O
for O
reducing O
environmental O
damage O
through O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
factors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
fear O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O

We O
have O
discovered O
serious O
errors O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC

We O
think O
that O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
, O
as O
they O
are O
currently O
planned O
and O
implemented O
, O
are O
wrong O
, O
that O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
all O
those O
who O
must O
be O
forced O
to O
be O
resettled O
by O
the O
project O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
is O
not O
possible O
and O
that O
the O
environmental O
impacts O
of O
the O
project O
are O
not O
carefully O
considered O
or O
adequately O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
World B-ORG

is O
just O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
situation O
that O
has O
resulted O
, O
as O

The O
Sardar O

a O

as O
two O

This O

a O
large O

the O
Narmada B-LOC

an O
extensive O
canal O

built O
on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC

near O
Navagam B-LOC

The O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-LOC
Dam I-LOC
is O
designed O
along O

that O

The O
canal O

the O

The O

a O

75 O

In O
1985 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

Within O
these O
agreements O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

treated O
only O

with O
the O

Our O
first O

The O
task O
for O

The O
idea O
of O
containing O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
dates O
back O
many O
years O
, O
but O
a O
realization O
was O
made O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
river O
flows O
through O
three O
states O
, O
which O
could O
not O
benefit O
from O
a O
division O
of O
project O

some O

In O

, O
the O

It O
talked O
about O
nine O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
World B-ORG

considered O
it O
necessary O

The O
World B-ORG

all O

engaged O

the O
most O

with O
us O

has O
given O
us O
the O
freedom O

we O
needed O
to O
carry O

We O
do O
not O

ever O
set O

such O
a O

no O

how O
controversial O
it O
was O
. O

The O
World B-ORG

determination O
to O
do O
this O
is O
evidence O
of O
its O
determination O
to O
want O
to O
understand O
what O
went O
wrong O
with O
the O

In O
the O

the O
position O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
judgement O

, O
land O

apply O

i.e. O
those O
who O

what O
in O

known O
as O

In O
their O
opinion O

it O
was O
not O
the O
intention O
of O
the O

that O
indigenous O

for O
which O
they O
do O

a O

In O
1980 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
adopted O
general O
resettlement O
principles O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

In O
doing O
so O
, O
she O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O
was O
not O
only O
about O
resettlement O
, O
but O
also O
about O
rehabilitation O

Therefore O
, O
it O
demands O
that O
displaced O
persons O
in O

must O
at O

regain O
their O
previous O
standard O
of O

This O
group O
of O
people O
should O
also O
include O
those O
displaced O
by O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
developed O
principles O
in O
1982 O
that O
specifically O
addressed O
indigenous O
peoples O
. O

It O
ensured O
that O
the O
traditional O
use O
of O

must O
be O
respected O
and O
demanded O
that O
it O
should O
only O

the O

is O
able O

Indeed O
, O
relocation O
measures O
on O
the O

the O
World B-ORG

were O
based O
on O
the O
measures O

down O
in O
the O
1979 O
arbitration O

This O
arbitration O
, O
however O
, O
only O
sought O
to O

He O
did O

he O
deal O

the O

nor O
did O
he O
take O
into O
account O
the O
cultural O

in O
the O

there O
is O
no O
discussion O
of O
tribal O

or O
land O

, O
or O
of O
the O
true O

1985 O
, O
when O
the O

there O
was O
no O
basis O
for O
the O
draft O

and O
compensation O

The O
number O

was O
unknown O
; O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
likely O

had O
never O

the O

So O
there O
was O

no O

the O
result O
that O
the O
human O

When O
the O
World B-ORG

signed O
the O

the O
Sardar O

the O

, O
i.e. O
those O
who O
did O
not O
include O

In O
addition O
, O
she O
dealt O
with O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
adult O
sons O
should O
receive O
land O
, O
not O
. O

This O
allowed O
the O
majority O
of O

tribal O
people O
to O
be O
deprived O
of O
their O
possessions O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
did O
not O
adopt O
separate O
provisions O
in O
the O
agreement O
on O
the O
channel O
for O
persons O
displaced O
or O
otherwise O
affected O
by O
the O

As O
distributors O
were O
defined O
only O
those O
affected O
by O
flooding O
or O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
the O
project O
, O
although O
in O
1980 O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
had O
already O
admitted O
that O
in O
the O
event O
of O
displacement O
by O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
systems O
relocation O
is O
necessary O
. O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
announced O
comprehensive O
resettlement O
principles O
to O
be O
applied O
in O
general O
to O
forced O
resettlement O
, O
and O
in O
1991 O
, O
it O
announced O
special O
resettlement O
principles O
for O
indigenous O
peoples O
. O

These O
statements O
repeated O
the O
principles O
defined O
a O
decade O
earlier O
and O
further O
differentiated O
them O
. O

These O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
principles O
reflect O
the O
general O
adoption O
of O
new O
human O
rights O
concepts O
. O

They O
recognize O
that O
large O
- O
scale O
projects O
, O
especially O
in O
rural O
, O
forest O
and O
rural O
areas O
, O
can O
expel O
people O
just O
as O
forcefully O
as O
war O
or O
natural O
disasters O
. O

They O
focus O
on O
people O
displaced O
by O
development O
progress O
and O
demand O
that O
in O
every O
project O
the O
human O
rights O
of O
displaced O
persons O
must O
be O
respected O
. O

According O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
these O
are O
rights O
which O
can O
not O
be O
invalidated O
by O
national O
sovereignty O
or O
national O
interests O
. O

Such O
considerations O
may O
justify O
a O
project O
, O
but O
according O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
they O
do O
not O
justify O
the O
annulment O
of O
these O
human O
rights O
by O
a O
project O
. O

The O
governments O
of O
the O
three O
states O
declare O
their O
readiness O
to O
implement O
the O
arbitration O

proceed O
according O
to O
the O
World B-ORG

However O
, O
there O
is O
disagreement O
about O
the O
interpretation O
. O

Gujarat B-LOC
, O
with O
4,700 O
displaced O
families O
, O
adopted O
a O
policy O
in O
1988 O
, O
after O
which O
every O
landlord O
displaced O
with O
land O
title O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O
are O
offered O
. O

It O
also O
offers O
to O
those O
who O
are O
classified O
as O
" O
landless O
" O
, O
2 O
hectares O
; O
tribal O
and O
other O
people O
who O
may O
work O
land O
without O
land O
title O
, O
thus O
receive O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O
. O

According O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
Proclamation O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
, O
also O
adult O

receive O
two O
hectares O
. O

The O
Government O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
the O
Governments O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
agree O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
goes O
beyond O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
and O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
guidelines I-MISC
. O

Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
where O
about O
3000 O
families O
have O
to O
be O
resettled O
, O
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
, O
with O
23 O

resettling O

, O
are O
ready O
to O
hand O
over O
two O
hectares O
of O
land O
to O
land O
- O
based O
displaced O
persons O
. O

But O
they O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
give O
two O
hectares O
for O
adult O
sons O
. O

Neither O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
nor O
Maharashtra B-LOC
recognises O
any O
rights O
for O
land O
compensation O
of O
people O
without O
land O
title O
. O

These O
differences O
in O
the O
policies O
of O
the O
states O
had O
resulted O
in O
a O
dispute O
over O
the O
importance O
of O
arbitration O
and O
the O
requirements O
of O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
credit O
agreements O
. O

The O
dispute O
may O
seem O
technical O
, O
but O
its O
outcome O
depends O
on O
the O
chances O
for O
thousands O
of O

by O
authors O

How O
can O
this O
be O
ensured O
in O
the O
case O
of O
displaced O
persons O
who O
only O
know O
agriculture O
as O
an O
occupation O
and O
in O
which O
it O
represents O
the O
heart O
of O
their O
social O
, O
economic O
and O
cultural O
life O
, O
if O
not O
by O
providing O
them O
with O
land O
for O
processing O
when O
relocating O
? O

In O
1984 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
Control O
Authority O
, O
which O
had O
been O
set O
up O
to O
monitor O
the O
project O
, O
declared O
: O

" O
For O
indigenous O
people O
there O
is O
no O
more O
effective O
rehabilitation O
than O
to O
provide O
land O
for O

. O
" O

We O
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
the O
only O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
improves O
or O
remains O
the O
same O
. O

The O
result O
, O
if O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
are O
referred O
to O
as O
landless O
, O
means O
that O
people O
who O
work O
the O
land O
they O
consider O
their O
own O
become O
landless O
workers O
. O

This O
is O
not O
rehabilitation O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
live O
at O
least O
as O
well O
as O
before O
. O

The O
tribal O
people O
in O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
very O
aware O
of O
this O
thing O
and O
what O
it O
means O
to O
them O
if O
they O
are O
relocated O
as O
landless O
farmers O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
Bamni B-LOC
, O
a O
tribal O
village O
in O
Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
people O
told O
us O
: O

" O
We O
are O
farmers O
, O
not O
workers O
. O
" O

In O
our O
view O
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
have O
not O
met O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
’s O
credit O
conditions O
, O
as O
they O
have O
failed O
to O
provide O
adequate O
land O
for O
rehabilitation O
of O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

The O
federal O
states O
argue O
that O
according O
to O
the O
arbitration O
and O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
all O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
where O
both O
land O
- O
owners O
and O
landless O
displaced O
persons O
are O
to O
receive O
two O
hectares O
of O
irrigated O
land O
. O

Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
therefore O
expect O
many O
displaced O
people O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
resettlement O
plan O
actually O
contains O
only O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
area O
needed O
for O
resettlement O
. O

But O
many O
displaced O
people O
do O
not O
want O
to O
move O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
for O
reasons O
that O
have O
to O
do O
with O
language O
, O
culture O
and O
other O
ties O
to O
the O
region O
. O

For O
many O
of O
them O
this O
would O
be O
a O
great O
cultural O
change O
. O

Both O
according O
to O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O
arbitration O
court O
and O
according O
to O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
be O
resettled O
in O
their O
own O
state O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
in O
carrying O
out O
resettlements O
in O
the O
last O
eighteen O
months O
, O
but O
so O
far O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
settled O
only O
about O
3000 O
families O
. O

Resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
so O
many O
more O
displaced O
persons O
- O
perhaps O
15,000 O
families O
- O
from O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
would O
be O
an O
enormous O
task O
for O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
would O
seriously O
burden O
its O
limited O
resources O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
about O
resettlement O
, O
it O
is O
also O
about O
rehabilitating O
people O
. O

The O
states O
may O
be O
able O
to O
organize O
the O
physical O
relocation O
of O
thousands O
of O
families O
on O
land O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O
rehabilitate O
them O
all O
. O

( O

) O

The O
only O
resettlement O
policy O
that O
all O
three O
states O
must O
apply O
is O
that O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
. O

But O
this O
policy O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
was O
not O
followed O
. O

The O

were O
not O
developed O
in O

requirements O
. O

Basic O
information O
was O
not O
collected O
and O
adequate O

plans O
were O
not O
drawn O
up O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
successes O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC

of O
the O
land O
offer O
for O
those O
displaced O
by O
flooding O
, O
for O
those O
already O
displaced O
in O
1960 O
- O
61 O
, O
when O
six O
villages O
in O
Kevadia B-LOC
were O
allocated O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
the O

no O

To O
make O
sure O
, O
some O

have O
been O
paid O
compensation O
in O
the O
form O
of O

But O
since O
1985 O
, O
these O
people O
have O
also O
been O
subject O
to O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG

Their O
right O
to O
land O
should O
have O
been O
recognised O
seven O
years O

, O
but O
the O
World B-ORG

failed O
to O
ensure O
recognition O

, O
the O

has O
only O
recently O
urged O

that O

the O

comply O
with O
the O
1979 O

, O
however O
, O
has O
not O

In O
the O

The O

so O

is O

Acquiring O

The O
history O

the O
environmental O
impacts O
of O
Sardar B-LOC

Sarovar I-LOC
is O
a O
history O
of O
unauthorized O
permits O
. O

There O
is O
no O
comprehensive O
document O
on O
the O
impacts O
. O

The O
type O
and O
extent O
of O
environmental O
problems O
and O
solutions O
are O
unknown O
. O

This O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
controversy O
surrounding O
the O
project O
. O

As O
with O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
, O
this O
fact O
has O
put O
our O
investigation O
in O
a O
difficult O
situation O
. O

To O
finish O
our O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
collect O
basic O
ecological O
information O
in O
order O
to O
describe O
the O
likely O
effects O
of O
the O
project O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
project O
’s O
catchment O
area O

This O
work O
should O
have O
been O
done O
by O
others O
before O
the O
projects O
were O
approved O
. O

( O
... O

. O

) O

We O
found O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
basic O
hydrological O
information O
related O
to O
these O
works O
( O
i.e. O
on O
dam O
and O
canal O
, O
i.e. O
) O
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
analyzed O
the O
water O
flow O
data O
and O
made O
our O
own O
analysis O
. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
projects O
will O
not O
work O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
problems O
relate O
to O
the O
frequency O
and O
time O
flow O
of O
stationary O
currents O
as O
well O
as O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
dam O
and O
canal O
to O
store O
and O
distribute O
water O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
, O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
will O
therefore O
be O
different O
than O
as O
currently O
assumed O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
built O
upstream O
as O
planned O
or O
not O
. O

A O
realistic O
operational O
analysis O
on O
which O
an O
environmental O
sustainability O
assessment O
could O
be O
based O
is O
lacking O
. O

This O
has O
alarmed O
us O
and O
it O
should O
also O
alarm O
others O
, O
especially O
with O
a O
mega O

project O
with O
such O
far O

reaching O
implications O
as O

The O
deficiencies O
we O
identified O
in O
the O
limiting O
of O
environmental O
damage O
also O
extend O
to O
the O
project O
’s O
catchment O
area O
. O

Although O
comprehensive O
studies O
are O
lacking O
, O
we O
found O
that O
there O
will O
likely O
be O
problems O
with O
ingestion O
and O
salting O
. O

Precalculations O
underlying O
the O
plans O
for O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
as O
well O
as O
protection O
measures O
are O
questionable O
. O

We O
can O
only O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
future O
problems O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
as O
a O
whole O
will O
be O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
found O
by O
the O
World B-ORG

in O
many O
other O

in O

From O

through O
the O
construction O
of O

the O

there O
is O
an O
inevitable O
danger O
that O

experienced O
some O
of O
the O

that O

But O
only O
in O
January O

we O
find O
statements O
by O
the O
World B-MISC
Bank I-MISC
adviser I-MISC
that O
the O
Sardar O

gave O
the O
impression O
that O
they O
were O
" O
planned O
, O

and O
carried O
out O
without O
the O
inclusion O
of O

He O
describes O
various O
parts O
of O
the O

as O
" O
deaths O
" O
and O
as O
" O
means O
of O
transport O
for O

and O
as O
a O
cause O
of O

for O

He O
reported O
a O
total O
collapse O

has O
risen O
steeply O
in O

The O
inability O
to O
predict O

is O
part O
of O

It O
is O

that O

the O

we O

that O
the O

That O
is O
why O
we O
believe O
that O
the O

be O
to O
withdraw O

set O
itself O
the O
goal O
to O
meet O
their O
energy O

with O
environmentally O
friendly O
renewable O

materials O
. O

It O
all O
started O
with O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
recognizing O
his O
ecological O
" O
sins O
" O
: O

During O
the O
construction O
of O
his O
house O
he O
had O
installed O
some O
electric O
floor O
heating O
. O
" O

Electricity O
" O
, O
that O
became O
clear O
to O
him O
only O
later O
, O
" O
is O
much O
too O
expensive O
to O
heat O
with O
. O
" O

Thus O
in O
1982 O
he O
replaced O
the O
floor O
heating O
with O
four O
furnaces O
, O
which O
are O
fed O
with O
dry O
beech O
wood O
. O

Not O
so O
comfortable O
, O
" O
he O
admits O
, O
" O
but O
ecologically O
more O
valuable O
. O
" O

About O
three O
years O
later O
, O
the O
churchyard B-PER
installed O
solar O
collectors O
, O
with O
which O
the O
water O
is O
heated O
to O
shower O
, O
wash O
and O
wash O
. O

Such O
solar O
systems O
for O
conventional O
water O
heating O
are O
relatively O
cheaper O
than O
those O
with O
photovoltaics O
, O
if O
you O
compare O
the O
price O
and O
the O
ecological O
benefits O
: O

" O
With O
10,000 O
marks O
, O
" O
Kirchhof B-PER
estimates O
, O
" O
a O
photovoltaic O
plant O
with O
half O
a O
kilowatt O
can O
be O
financed O
, O
saving O
about O
0.5 O
tons O
of O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O
" O

The O
same O
amount O
could O
also O
be O
paid O
for O
a O
complete O
conventional O
water O
heating O
system O
. O

And O
the O
spare O
considerably O
more O
carbon O

This O
is O
why O
solar O
thermal O
power O
is O
promoted O
in O

a O

According O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O
Environment O
, O
the O
country O
grants O
up O
to O
3000 O
marks O
for O
such O

, O
but O
not O
more O
than O
30 O
percent O
of O
the O

. O

However O
, O
this O

programme O
is O
only O
a O
few O

In O

about O
the O

- O
not O
only O
because O
it O
has O
brought O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
is O
not O
entirely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
: O

Although O
the O

were O
cheaper O
for O
2500 O
German B-MISC
builders O
through O
the O
promotion O
and O
for O
some O
perhaps O
even O

However O
, O
the O

did O
not O
ensure O
a O
real O
breakthrough O
in O
environmentally O

technology O
, O
because O
the O
market O

not O

. O

For O
this O
reason O
Kirchhof B-PER
considers O
the O
directives O
to O
be O
worth O
improving O

Somehow O
, O
because O
the O
American B-MISC

could O
not O
make O
the O
formal O
decision O
on O
the O
sale O
at O
the O
last O
meeting O
yet O
. O

The O
reason O
: O

Some O
of O
the O
conditions O
that O
the O
Minister O
had O
placed O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
met O
. O

The O
highest O
hurdle O
: O

In O
a O
vote O
, O
two O
thirds O
of O
the O
tenants O
must O
agree O
to O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
to O
the O
cooperative O
. O

Whether O
this O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
is O
completely O
open O
. O

In O
November O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
to O
decide O
in O
secret O
vote O
on O
the O
future O
fate O
of O
the O
houses O
. O

Should O
this O
vote O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
, O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
of O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
hometown I-ORG
can O
finally O
approve O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
settlement O
at O
the O
next O
meeting O
on O
30 O
November O
. O

This O
ended O
a O
seven O
- O
year O
political O
struggle O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
settlement O
from O
the O
1920s O
. O

( O
For O
the O
background O
, O

boxes O
on O

) O

The O
further O
conditions O
of O
the O
Minister O
of O
Housing O
can O
be O
more O
easily O
fulfilled O
by O
the O
cooperative O
: O

It O
must O
accede O
to O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Treaty I-MISC
" O
. O

It O
provides O
that O
all O
apartments O
that O
become O
free O
must O
be O
notified O
to O
the O
Housing B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
and O
can O
be O
occupied O
by O
the O
Authority O
with O
new O
tenants O
. O

This O
condition O
is O
easy O
to O
meet O
, O
said O
the O
board O
member O
of O
the O
cooperative O
, O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Another O
condition O
of O
the O
Minister O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
rental O
price O
piece O
by O
piece O
up O
to O
a O
square O
meter O
price O
of O
8.50 O
marks O
. O

This O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
cooperative O
can O
work O
profitably O
and O
that O
the O
country O
does O
not O
have O
to O
stand O
by O
in O
a O
plea O
for O
outstanding O
debts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
cooperation O
also O
lacks O
a O
so O
- O
called O
" O
maintenance O
certificate O
" O
according O
to O
information O
from O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
: O

It O
is O
intended O
to O
clarify O
in O
principle O
whether O
a O
small O
cooperative O
can O
lead O
the O
stock O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
of O
only O
1072 O
apartments O
at O
all O
profitable O
. O

If O
all O
conditions O
are O
met O
, O
the O
home O
settlement O
can O
change O
owner O
for O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
about O
80 O
million O
marks O
. O

The O
sum O
is O
as O
follows O
: O

48,3 O
million O
marks O
give O
the O
country O
to O
the O
cooperation O
as O
a O
zero O
- O
interest O
contribution O
. O

This O
sum O
received O
in O
1986 O
the O
Nassau B-ORG
home I-ORG
for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
estate O
of O
the O
New O
Home O
. O

So O
the O
money O
is O
simply O
" O
passed O
on O
" O
. O

The O
missing O
sum O
of O
about O
32 O
million O
marks O
is O
currently O
covered O
by O
mortgages O
, O
which O
should O
also O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
new O
partnership O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
hiring O
increase O
serves O
to O
gradually O
offset O
the O
basic O
debt O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
repay O
the O
state O
surcharge O
. O

The O
association O
currently O
has O
about O
350 O
members O
. O

It O
promises O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
above O
all O
a O
" O
share O
management O
" O
, O
as O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O
" O

There O
are O
no O
alienated O
working O
conditions O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
not O
numbers O
and O
in O
the O
long O
term O
they O
will O
determine O
business O
policy O
, O
" O
Schneider B-PER
continued O
. O

Adequate O
checkpoints O
had O
been O
installed O
, O
she O
assured O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
tenants O
would O
again O
be O
exposed O
to O
the O
uncertainties O
as O
they O
had O
arisen O
after O
the O
deportation O
of O
the O
former O
owner O
New O
Home O
. O

However O
, O
not O
all O
tenants O
seem O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

They O
show O
satisfaction O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
through O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimstätte I-ORG
and O
see O
through O
the O
vote O
and O
discussion O
about O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
unnecessary O
unrest O
brought O
to O
the O
Sachsenhäuser B-MISC
residential O
district O
. O

To O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
many O
tenants O
also O
contributes O
that O
the O
maintenance O
status O
of O
the O
apartments O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Only O
recently O
the O
gas O
lines O
in O
the O
settlement O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
the O
grid O
, O
as O
the O
money O
for O
a O
renovation O
was O
lacking O
. O

However O
, O
the O
members O
of O
the O
cooperative O
are O
optimistic O
: O

" O
We O
will O
work O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
tenants O
in O
the O
requested O
majority O
support O
the O
acquisition O
, O
" O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O

Will O
it O
succeed O
to O
inspire O
nearly O
67 O
percent O
of O
tenants O
for O
the O
first O
establishment O
of O
a O

the O

The O
conflict O

in O

had O
to O

in O

the O

" O
was O

which O

than O
500 O

and O
was O
supposed O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
establishment O

Because O

not O
fall O
into O

it O

was O
able O
to O

no O

The O
question O
that O

asked O

the O
Nassau B-ORG

was O
whether O
it O
was O
willing O

the O

the O

Already O
around O

the O

largely O

to O
have O

to O
the O

It O
seems O
problematic O
in O
this O
line O
construction O
that O
the O
architects O
can O
not O
realize O
their O
own O
specifications O
. O
" O

Many O

have O
a O

, O
it O

The O
free O

however O
, O
they O

Unhindered O
the O

As O
in O

want O

only O
at O

Meireis B-PER
explained O
clearly O
: O

" O
The O
situation O
of O
the O
children O
in O

extremely O
bad O
. O
" O

The O
figures O
are O
alarming O
: O

Only O
a O

in O
the O

have O
fully O
or O

the O

Only O
about O

The O
result O
: O

In O

This O

breaks O
out O

Meireis B-PER

The O

for O
up O

The O
question O
from O
the O
local O

, O
how O
to O
improve O
this O
precarious O
situation O
, O
brought O
the O
youth O
doctor O
to O
a O
simple O
formula O
: O

" O
If O
you O
want O
to O
do O
more O
, O
you O
need O
more O

. O
" O

It O
is O
important O
to O
intensify O

he O
said O

We O
can O
think O

says O
Krämer B-PER

: O

A O

even O

the O

said O

In O

been O

for O
some O
time O

for O

character O
. O

Now O
, O
as O
Europe B-LOC
's O
borders O
lose O
more O
and O
more O
importance O
, O
new O
possibilities O
arise O
: O

The O
Elsasser B-MISC
is O
a O
Frenchman B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
a O
European O
with O
his O
own O
, O
regional O
, O
historically O
rooted O
identity O
, O
whose O
cultural O
symbol O
is O
bilingualism O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
before O
such O
a O
vision O
can O
be O
achieved O
. O

Actually O
, O
what O
is O
at O
stake O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
to O
reverse O
a O
trend O
irrevocably O
, O
which O
has O
been O
applied O
after O
the O
war O
and O
which O
in O
the O
traditional O
German O
- O
speaking B-MISC
Alsace B-LOC
made O
German B-MISC
largely O
a O
foreign O
language O
. O

Suppressed O
, O
even O
banned O
, O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
the O
High B-MISC
German I-MISC
as O
its O
written O
form O
of O
expression O
were O
not O
. O

But O
the O
framework O
conditions O
ensured O
that O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
and O
the O
Germans B-MISC
were O
increasingly O
repulsed O
. O

Thus O
, O
many O
local O
and O
street O
signs O
were O
franchised B-MISC
. O

The O
official O
postal O
service O
could O
only O
be O
operated O
in O
French B-MISC
soon O
after O
the O
war O
. O

In O
the O
kindergartens O
, O
even O
Elsesian B-MISC
singers O
disappeared O
from O
the O
program O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
lessons I-MISC
at O
the O
schools O
were O
reduced O
. O

In O
the O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
the O
popular O
sports O
section O
had O
to O
appear O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

In O
not O
few O
families O
existed O
and O
exist O
two O
language O
worlds O
: O

Parents O
talk O
in O
the O
dialect O
, O
the O
conversations O
with O
the O
children O
take O
place O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

The O
consequence O
: O

French B-MISC
quickly O
developed O
into O
the O
dominant O
spoken O
language O
in O
the O
Alsace O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
regional O
editions O
lost O
and O
are O
still O
losing O
in O
circulation O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
younger O
people O
are O
no O
longer O
powerful O
. O

In O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
patron O
can O
help O
German B-MISC
guests O
who O
do O
not O
speak O
French B-MISC
, O
often O
even O
linguistically O
, O
which O
is O
usually O
not O
possible O
for O
the O
young O
operator O
or O
saleswoman O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
seventies O
, O
EGEurope B-LOC
did O
not O
remain O
ineffective O
- O
the O
German B-MISC
instruction I-MISC
in O
schools O
was O
extended O
again O
. O

The O
French B-MISC
and O
Baden B-MISC
school O
authorities O
agreed O
a O
program O
to O
promote O
the O
playful O
learning O
of O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
neighbour O
" O
at O
primary O
school O
age O
, O
including O
mutual O
classroom O
visits O
, O
and O
the O
resonance O
in O
the O
schools O
was O
enormous O
. O

But O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
real O
" O
bilinguism O
" O
associations O
such O
as O
the O
René B-ORG
- I-ORG
Schickele I-ORG
- O
Kreis O
, O
which O
is O
strong O
for O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
- I-LOC
Lothringen I-LOC
, O
had O
to O
feel O
for O
a O
long O
time O
still O
as O
lonely O
callers O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

But O
with O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Wall O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
the O
Iron B-MISC
Curtain I-MISC
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
it O
has O
become O
almost O
fashionable O
in O
the O
social O
life O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
to O
advocate O
" O
le O
bilinguisme O
" O
. O

The O
most O
visible O
expression O
of O
this O
development O
: O

In O
more O
and O
more O
places O
, O
the O
French B-MISC
street O
names O
are O
accompanied O
by O
Alsace B-MISC
subtitles O
. O

So O
now O
in O
Mülhausen B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Marechaux I-LOC
" O
is O
also O
called O
" O
Schmidgass B-LOC
" O
, O
in O
Colmar B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Prêtres I-LOC
" O
is O
occupied O
with O
the O
title O
" O
Pfaffegassle B-LOC
" O
which O
sounds O
somewhat O
disrespectful O
to O
German O
ears O
. O

The O
core O
issue O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
the O
language O
teaching O
in O
schools O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
transmission O
of O
German B-MISC
to O
the O
schools O
in O
Alsace B-MISC
is O
further O
intensified O
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
model O
project O
, O
German B-MISC
was O
spoken O
to O
around O
60 O
classes O
in O
30 O
elementary O
schools O
three O
hours O
a O
week O
outside O
the O
usual O
German I-MISC
classes I-MISC
in O
various O
subjects O
in O
the O
school O
year O
that O
has O
just O
ended O
. O

A O
spectacular O
success O
has O
been O
achieved O
by O
the O
ABCM B-MISC
Citizens I-MISC
' O
Initiative O
, O
which O
has O
already O
involved O
about O
800 O
parents O
and O
teachers O
: O

Supported O
by O
subsidies O
from O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
Regional O
Council O
, O
the O
two O
General O
Councils O
and O
even O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
also O
with O
the O
practical O
help O
of O
some O
municipalities O
, O
six O
now O
really O
bilingual O
pre O
- O
school O
classes O
could O
be O
set O
up O
, O
in O
which O
13 O
hours O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
13 O
hours O
of O
German B-MISC
are O
spoken O
. O

This O
first O
significant O
advance O
towards O
" O
bilinguism O
" O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
are O
still O
facing O
a O
persistent O
opponent O
- O
and O
that O
is O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
. O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
he O
is O
present O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
national O
school O
authority O
. O

Since O
1982 O
, O
in O
principle O
, O
a O
law O
allows O
equal O
instruction O
in O
French B-MISC
and O
the O
respective O
regional O
language O
, O
if O
parents O
so O
wish O
. O

This O
directive O
was O
implemented O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
in O
Brittany B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

The O
real O
concern O
of O
ABCM B-ORG
is O
the O
establishment O
of O
bilingual O
classes O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
official O
state O
school O
system O
. O

The O
municipal O
council O
of O
Mülhausen B-LOC
also O
made O
a O
corresponding O
decision O
. O

However O
, O
ABCM B-ORG
was O
left O
with O
nothing O
but O
to O
make O
a O
first O
move O
with O
bilingual O
kindergartens O
on O
a O
private O
basis O
. O

But O
even O
these O
initiatives O
encounter O
resistance O
in O
some O
places O
, O
the O
promised O
subsidies O
of O
the O
EC B-ORG
and O
the O
Alsace B-MISC
regional O
bodies O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
exploited O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
opportunity O
: O

Sometimes O
the O
municipalities O
did O
not O
provide O
space O
, O
with O
ABCM B-ORG
suggesting O
that O
the O
state O
school O
authority O
occasionally O
also O
exerts O
pressure O
on O
mayors O
. O

In O
the O
most O
spectacular O
dispute O
in O
Pulversheim B-LOC
the O
teachers O
of O
the O
state O
school O
defend O
themselves O
, O
with O
backing O
of O
a O
teacher O
's O
association O
, O
against O
that O
in O
the O
same O
building O
in O
a O
( O
otherwise O
unused O
! O

) O
Room O
was O
accommodated O
a O
bilingual O
ABCM B-MISC
pre I-MISC
- O
school O
class O
. O

The O
Mairie O
and O
the O
school O
administration O
had O
already O
confronted O
themselves O
in O
court O
. O

The O
matter O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
settled O
definitively O
. O

After O
all O
: O

" O
State O
" O
and O
" O
private O
" O
children O
can O
now O
use O
the O
same O
toilet O
and O
also O
play O
together O
in O
the O
breaks O
- O
which O
at O
first O
did O
not O
go O
. O

" O
Haut B-ORG
Comité I-ORG
" O
- O
President O
Goetschy B-PER
complains O
that O
too O
few O
dialect O
broadcasts O
are O
still O
broadcast O
on O
radio O
and O
television O
. O

Concerned O
the O
politician O
shows O
that O
the O
most O
recent O
reform O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
constitution O
explicitly O
stipulated O
that O
French B-MISC
is O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
Republic O
" O
, O
but O
the O
importance O
of O
regional O
languages O
is O
not O
mentioned O
anywhere O
. O

The O
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
are O
probably O
not O
wrong O
in O
their O
assumption O
that O
behind O
disinterest O
and O
persistent O
resistance O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
lies O
the O
fear O
of O
a O
sluggish O
" O
Germanization B-MISC
" O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
of O
a O
" O
decoupling O
" O
of O
this O
region O
, O
also O
the O
will O
, O
the O
dominance O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
thus O
also O
the O
political O
priority O
of O
centralism O
in O
no O
way O
to O
give O
up O
. O

But O
even O
the O
most O
determined O
supporters O
of O
" O
bilinguism O
" O
clearly O
define O
themselves O
as O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
as O
Europeans B-MISC
and O
Alsatians B-MISC
, O
who O
want O
to O
preserve O
and O
rebuild O
a O
social O
and O
cultural O
regional O
identity O
through O
bilingualism O
in O
a O
growing O
Europe B-LOC
. O

So O
not O
only O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
overcome O
resistance O
. O

There O
are O
also O
contradictions O
in O
Elsass B-LOC
itself O
. O

Thus O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
city B-ORG
administration I-ORG
of O
Strasbourg O
, O
60 O
streets O
and O
squares O
with O
their O
historical O
German B-MISC
names O
to O
undertitle O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
European B-MISC
city I-MISC
on O
unexpectedly O
fierce O
protest O
, O
which O
settled O
in O
numerous O
reader O
letters O
buried O
Strasbourg B-MISC
citizens O
and O
thoughtful O
comments O
in O
the O
media O
. O

German B-MISC
, O
according O
to O
the O
critics O
, O
was O
not O
only O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-MISC
student O
Goethe B-PER
, O
but O
also O
the O
language O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

There O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
Nazi B-MISC
period I-MISC
in O
Alsace B-LOC
continued O

the O

can O
see O
themselves O
in O
the O

Only O
the O
practical O

with O

the O

The O
idea O
to O
set O
up O
a O
youth O
parliament O
in O
Bad B-LOC
Homburg I-LOC
. O

On O
June O
14th O
last O
year O
, O
the O
young O
people O
came O
together O
to O
take O
suggestions O
from O
young O
people O
in O
their O
parliament O
and O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
" O
great O
" O
politics O
. O

The O
initial O
scepticism O
among O
the O
" O
grown O
- O
up O
" O
politicians O
is O
clear O
. O

But O
how O
do O
the O
young O

see O
their O
own O
parliament O
? O

" O
It O

played O
out O

Youth O

committee O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
last O
year O
, O
which O
brought O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
, O
but O
so O
far O
little O
success O
. O

The O

of O
the O
young O
Bad B-MISC
Homburger I-MISC
went O
first O
to O
give O
the O
work O
of O
the O
youth O
parliament O
a O
firm O
framework O
to O
give O
the O
young O
people O
an O
influence O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
council O
of O
elders O
of O
the O
city O
parliament O
has O
now O
decided O
to O
grant O
young O
people O
the O
right O
to O
speak O
in O
committees O
- O
but O
only O
on O
the O
proposals O
they O
put O
forward O
. O

" O
We O
did O
n't O
find O
a O
right O
of O
speech O
in O
all O

so O
favourable O
, O
" O
says O
Mayor O
Maria B-PER
Scholz I-PER
. O

She O
has O
accompanied O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
, O
it O
was O
right O
to O
limit O
the O
influence O
of O
young O
people O
, O
but O
in O
the O
points O
they O
put O
forward O
, O
" O
to O
take O
on O
the O
duty O
so O
that O
they O
learn O
to O
listen O
and O
ask O
questions O
" O
. O

This O
educational O
approach O
disturbs O
the O
chairman O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
Group I-MISC
in O
the O
city O
parliament O
, O
Renate B-PER
Bill I-PER
. O

She O
fears O
that O
a O
" O
conflict O
potential O
" O
of O
young O
people O
, O
which O
should O
also O
be O
used O
constructively O
, O
will O
be O
channelled O
through O
parliamentary O
work O
" O
in O
solid O
tracks O
" O
. O

Many O
things O
can O
be O

in O
open O

. O

Peter B-PER
Walz I-PER
of O

also O
fears O
that O
this O
" O
would O
bind O
energies O
that O
could O
be O

elsewhere O
" O
. O

For O
him O
there O
is O
no O
youth O
parliament O
, O
" O
if O
it O
can O
not O
pass O
anything O
" O
. O

The O
young O
people O
do O
not O
have O
so O
little O
hope O
: O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
them O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
parliamentary O
life O
. O
” O

Only O
then O
will O
we O
take O
part O
in O
the O
decisions O
, O
" O
says O
Markus B-PER
Schulz I-PER
, O
who O
also O
sits O
in O
the O
Committee O
on O
Coordination O
. O

Results O
are O
especially O
important O
to O
him O
: O

" O
We O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
prove O
something O
. O

Then O
the O
young O
people O
also O
take O
this O
seriously O
and O
continue O
to O
support O
us O
. O
" O

For O
one O
thing O
the O
young O
parliamentarians O
have O
recognised O
: O

Without O
support O
among O
the O
peers O
, O
the O
youth O
parliament O
will O
not O
go O
any O
further O
. O
" O

We O
are O
really O
just O
the O
representatives O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pass O
on O
what O
young O
people O
bring O
to O
us O
. O
" O

This O
viewpoint O
they O
also O
represent O
so O
vehemently O
, O
because O
they O
do O
not O
want O
that O
" O
so O
a O
mentality O
arises O
: O

" O
We O
have O
our O
officials O
now O
and O
they O
are O
already O
doing O
that O
. O
" O

Only O
a O
few O
suggestions O
have O
so O
far O
reached O
the O
youth O
parliament O
. O

Perhaps O
because O
the O
young O
people O
first O
had O
to O
enter O
the O
depths O
of O
local O
politics O
themselves O
. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
this O
is O

" O

A O
hope O
that O
also O
shares O
the O
SPD B-MISC

chair I-MISC
Beate B-PER
Fleige I-PER
. O

She O
considers O
it O
crucial O
that O
" O

even O
the O
young O

themselves O
articulate O
what O
they O
need O
. O
" O

That O
much O
has O

come O
yet O
, O
" O
said O
Franz B-PER
Kaunzner I-PER
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
CDU O
group O
. O

He O
regards O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
primarily O
as O
an O
exercise O
room O
: O

" O
If O
one O
sometimes O
wonders O
how O
great O
the O
ignorance O
is O
, O
" O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
youth O
parliament O
could O
certainly O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
opinion O
among O
young O
people O
. O

What O
he O
urges O
, O
however O
, O
is O
continuity O
: O

" O
If O
they O
send O
another O
representative O
every O
time O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
. O
" O

This O
has O
also O
been O
recognised O
by O
young O
people O
: O

They O
do O
not O
want O
to O
worship O
the O
principle O
of O
rotation O
. O

But O
also O
they O
will O
grow O
up O
once O
the O
youth O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
their O
term O
of O
office O
is O
sometimes O
one O
year O
. O

What O
comes O
after O
that O
, O
even O
the O
young O
people O
do O
not O
know O
. O

They O
strongly O
oppose O
considering O
their O
establishment O
as O
a O
young O
tenant O
: O

" O
Nothing O
has O
been O
forged O
here O
yet O
, O
" O
white O
cows B-PER
say O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
join O
the O
party O
, O
go O
directly O
to O
their O
youth O
organisation O
- O
without O
going O
through O
the O

parliament O
. O

He O
himself O
is O
far O
from O
thinking O
of O
a O
political O
career O
: O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O

On O

For O

He O
was O

three O

According O
to O
the O
judgment O
, O
the O
sentence O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
subjected O
to O
review O
because O
of O
the O
previous O

the O

: O

" O
But O
this O
only O

also O
considering O
how O
to O

Already O
in O
1991 O

had O
demanded O
a O

to O
reduce O

on O

Now O
the O

launched O
a O

demanded O
at O
the O

" O

" O
Günter B-PER

justified O
the O

" O
that O

But O
even O

Weatherling B-PER
: O

" O
Since O
we O
ca O

simply O

" O

This O
would O
only O
be O
possible O
if O
" O
the O

a O
narrow O

. O

But O
here O

as O

in O
other O
cases O
have O
already O
emphasized O
, O
the O
cat O
in O

: O

It O
is O

because O
the O

and O
because O
the O

, O
the O

So O
it O

going O
on O

Anton B-PER
Winter I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG

had O
already O
suspected O
during O
the O
council O
meeting O
that O
the O
city O
would O
in O
no O
way O
prescribe O
speed O
30 O
on O
the O
alley B-LOC
ring I-LOC
- O
and O
thus O
also O
justified O
the O
rejection O
of O
his O
group O
. O

With O
a O
speed O
reduction O
it O
was O
not O
done O
, O
Winter B-PER
said O
beyond O
that O
. O

Rather O
, O
the O
islands O
should O
be O
enlarged O
. O

Only O
then O
would O
pedestrians O
be O
safer O
. O

A O
view O
that O
also O
Günther B-PER
Boege I-PER
supported O
. O

But O
the O
SPD B-MISC
group I-MISC
could O
not O
get O
along O
with O
the O
idea O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O

A O
reconstruction O
of O
the O
entire O
crossing O
will O
only O
make O
sense O
, O
argued O
its O
chairman O
Bernd B-PER
Scherf I-PER
, O
once O
the O
underground O
construction O
is O
completed O
. O

Previously O
such O
a O
project O
would O
be O
much O
too O
expensive O
. O

Transport O
planner O
Klaus B-PER
Wetterling I-PER
shares O
this O
view O
. O

It O
was O
only O
six O
years O
ago O
that O
the O
square O
was O
redesigned O
for O
underground O
construction O
. O
" O

Even O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
every O
track O
, O
why O
should O
we O
now O
pay O
for O
a O

first O

her O

Only O
now O

what O

So O
she O
fought O
hard O

Now O
she O
fights O

Immediately O
after O
her O

she O
took O

of O

about O
the O

, O

she O
hit O

something O
for O

: O

" O
For O

, O
setting O
up O
an O

was O
not O

even O
after O

The O
reasoning O
was O

Do O

For O
this O
reason O
Hilde B-PER

holds O
on O
to O
her O
seniors O
advice O
: O

" O

The O
fear O
of O
the O

Hilde B-PER

legitimizes O

to O

a O
phrase O
that O
one O

from O

something O

she O
does O
everything O

she O
fought O

Sometimes O
, O
however O

she O
gets O
a O
feeling O

her O
a O
bit O

In O

not O
feared O

now O
she O
is O
already O

the O
path O

resistance O

their O

these O

" O
explains O
the O
city O

Gregor B-PER
Weiser I-PER
for O

, O
why O
the O

have O
agreed O

which O
applies O
only O

even O
though O

Weiser O
also O
refers O
to O
the O
argument O
of O

First O

Klaus B-PER
Minkel I-PER
, O
that O
Paragraph O

of O

Federal O
Construction O
Act O
allows O
sufficient O
design O
by O
the O

( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O

. O

The O
argument O
calls O
Weiser O
" O
short O
- O
sightedness O
coupled O
with O
rationalism O
" O
. O

For O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
which O

the O
subsequent O
CDU B-ORG
, O
which O
also O
ruled O

for O
14 O
years O
, O
according O
to O
Weiser O
, O
had O
enough O
time O
, O
paragraph O

" O

point O
out O

Looking O
at O

however O

it O
turns O
out O
: O

Paragraph O

does O
not O

much O

" O

Weiser B-PER
also O
pointed O
out O
the O
wild O
growth O
of O

in O
this O
connection O

According O
to O
the O
case O

it O
could O
not O
be O
circumscribed O
by O
paragraph O
34 O
, O

only O
by O
a O

principle O

Above O
all O
, O
however O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
’s O
favoured O
coordination O
of O

with O
the O

only O
hides O
the O

if O

” O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
now O
possible O
for O

to O
prevent O
its O
unsustainable O
construction O
projects O
by O
threatening O

" O
, O
Weiser B-PER
points O
out O

The O
result O
: O

" O
The O
builders O
do O
not O
know O
what O
the O
city O

. O

Suddenly O
they O
are O
threatened O

Wolfgang B-PER

they O
also O

can O
well O
imagine O
that O

will O
eventually O
disappear O
from O
the O
statutes O
of O

Since O
the O
singing O
clubs O
also O
and O
above O
all O
want O
to O
reach O
the O
younger O

, O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
, O
in O

to O

" O
anecdotes B-PER
of I-PER
Tharau I-PER
, O
but O
with O
pieces O
from O
musicals O
and O
modern O
music O
also O
to O
inspire O
the O
youth O
for O
choir O
singing O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
singers O
see O
themselves O
as O
victims O
of O
the O
dilemma O
that O
a O
composer O
composes O
only O
if O
he O
also O
knows O
that O
this O
work O
is O
bought O
for O
him O
. O

And O
this O
, O
according O
to O
Claus O
- O
Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER
, O
is O
still O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
in O
modern O
music O
. O

The O
trend O
of O
many O
horns O
still O
goes O
to O
sing O
( O
and O
buy O
) O
what O
you O
know O
. O

Consequently O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
the O
clubs O
have O
little O
literature O
that O
is O
appealing O
to O
young O
people O
, O
Blaschke B-PER
explains O
and O
gets O
into O
a O
frenzy O
over O
the O
choral O
edits O
of O
the O
Beatles B-MISC
song I-MISC
" O
Let O
it O
be O
" O
. O

New O
compositions O
allowed O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
also O
a O
stronger O
confrontation O
with O
today O
's O
times O
. O
" O

When O
I O
see O
our O
nature O
misery O
, O
then O
I O
can O
sing O
, O
Oh O
, O
You O
beautiful O
forest O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
thing O
has O
a O
meaning O
. O

But O
it O
could O
also O
be O
a O
contemporary O
composer O
to O
write O
a O
work O
about O
the O
extinction O
of O
the O
forest O
. O

But O
he O
only O
does O
it O
if O
he O
can O
also O
sell O
it O
. O
" O

Only O
if O
a O
solution O
is O
found O
, O
the O
clubs O
open O
themselves O
to O
the O
youth O
and O
care O
for O
them O
, O
the O
choir O
singing O
can O
have O
a O
future O
in O
his O
opinion O
. O

Some O
churches O
in O
the O

he O
also O
prophesies O
their O
extinction O
. O

Other O
horns O
, O
such O
as O
the O
international O
children O

choir O
from O
Oberursel B-LOC
or O
the O
" O
Stierstädter B-ORG
Spatzen I-ORG
" O
let O
him O
look O
forward O
with O
hope O
. O

Especially O
the O
singing O
for O
him O
besides O
the O
purely O
musical O
also O
promotes O
the O
" O
communal O
sense O
" O
. O

In O
our O
society O
, O
the O
association O
represents O
in O
his O
eyes O
a O
cell O
of O
personal O
contacts O
: O

the O
group O
dynamic O
aspect O
as O
" O
important O
by O
- O
product O
" O
of O
singing O
. O

But O
he O
also O
finds O
that O
" O
singing O
liberates O
" O
and O
most O
hobbyists O
" O
simply O
and O
simply O
makes O
fun O
" O
. O

Even O
more O
fun O
should O
make O
them O
produce O
" O
quality O
" O
, O
so O
his O
conviction O
. O

The O
openness O
demanded O
by O
him O
must O
also O
mean O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
new O
, O
difficult O
and O
unknown O
pieces O
. O

But O
that O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
spectrum O
of O
the O
horns O
clear O
, O
is O
different O
from O
club O
to O
club O

in O

does O

Recently O
the O

been O
added O

The O

not O
frighten O
the O

Blaschke B-PER
stresses O

" O

” O

To O
this O
the O

can O
nevertheless O
not O
close O
, O
as O
the O

continue O
a O
tradition O
that O
took O
its O
beginning O
in O
the O
19th O

. O

The O
young O

wanted O
to O
protest O
with O
their O

Many O

were O
created O
until O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC

, O
after O
which O
the O

Even O

; O
the O
" O

A O

of O

that O

reduced O

as O

The O
proposal O
was O
unanimously O
adopted O
by O

Not O
so O
unanimous O
was O
the O
consent O
of O
the O
local O
couple O
to O
a O
second O
SPD B-MISC
initiative I-MISC
. O

In O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O

the O
Social B-ORG

called O
for O

on O

to O
be O
operated O
every O
10 O
minutes O
, O
every O
20 O

and O
every O
half O

afterwards O
. O

In O
order O
to O
accommodate O
as O
many O
passengers O
as O
possible O
at O
a O
denser O
rate O
of O
the O
" O
44ers O
" O
, O
smaller O

should O
be O
used O
. O

The O
local O
council O
approved O
the O
motion O
against O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
CDU B-MISC
. O

As O
their O
chairman O
Dieter B-PER
Kunzler I-PER
said O
, O
the O
44er O
is O
a O
" O
ghost O
bus O
" O
anyway O
, O
which O
is O
hardly O
used O
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O
. O

He O
described O
it O
as O
" O
not O
particularly O
meaningful O
" O
to O
let O
the O
bus O
roll O
even O
more O
often O
" O
through O
the O
narrow O
streets O
of O
Fechenheim B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
is O
not O
an O
argument O
against O
a O
shorter O
time O
frame O
, O
said O
Albrecht B-PER
Reinhard I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
. O

Just O
because O
the O
bus O
travels O
so O
rarely O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cheap O
means O
of O
transport O
and O
is O
therefore O
used O
only O
little O
. O

This O
will O
change O
if O
the O
44er O
drives O
more O
frequently O
, O
speculated O
the O
Free O
Democrat O
. O

This O
has O
been O
confirmed O
by O
a O
magistrate O

report O
everywhere O
where O
the O

is O
well O
accessible O
by O

Reinhard B-PER

in O

known O

- O
. O

Objective O
of O
the O
action O
: O

The O
adults O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
their O
older O
siblings O
lacked O
equipment O
to O
play O
on O
the O
playground O
there O
. O

The O
square O
was O
set O
up O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Another O
drawback O
: O

The O
place O
is O
often O
driven O
by O
cars O
that O
have O
nothing O
to O
look O
for O
there O
. O

For O

, O
a O
large O
, O
with O
square O
stones O

place O
in O
Fechenheimer B-MISC
Ortskern O
, O
is O
a O
pedestrian O

. O

Actually O
, O
only O
a O
few O

with O
appropriate O
ID O

should O
drive O
over O
the O
" O

, O
between O
5 O

11 O
o'clock O
are O
also O
permitted O

. O

Initially O
the O
parents O
therefore O
wanted O
to O
block O
during O
the O

week O
also O
the O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
, O
from O
which O
can O
be O
reached O
from O
the O

. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
action O
was O
supported O
by O
two O
honorary O
staff O
, O
the O
initiative O
of O
this O
project O
had O
to O
be O
abandoned O
again O
. O

For O
the O
employees O
of O
an O
authority O
is O
expressly O
forbidden O
to O
participate O
in O
such O
- O
humbly O
considered O
- O
illegal O
acts O
. O

However O
, O
the O
parents O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
up O
the O
help O
of O
the O
two O
teachers O
and O
the O
toys O
of O
the O

. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
game O

also O
went O
well O
without O
roadblocks O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
mother O
of O

. O

On O
the O
first O
two O
days O
, O
about O
30 O
children O
had O
been O
there O
, O

and O
buried O
themselves O

Also O
a O

On O

day O

then O
the O
rain O

ended O
the O

to O

the O

This O
will O
be O
better O
in O

are O
to O

On O
the O
wooden O
playhouse O
that O
the O
children O
wanted O
, O
the O
little O
ones O
will O
have O
to O
give O
up O
. O

The O
construction O
of O
such O
a O
hut O
is O
too O
expensive O
and O
also O
linked O
with O
numerous O
security O
installations O
, O
Gabi B-PER

Replacement O
offered O
during O
the O
game O
week O
a O
wooden O
climbing O
equipment O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
. O

A O
major O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
playground O
remains O
: O

It O
is O
simply O
too O
small O
to O
accommodate O
all O
children O
who O
want O
to O
play O
there O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
younger O
generation O
has O
already O
acquired O
ownership O
of O
a O
part O
of O
the O
Linneplatz B-LOC

There O
, O
however O
, O
the O

do O
not O

uninterrupted O
. O

Because O
, O
as O
Gabi B-PER

reported O
, O

are O
always O

He O
objected O
to O
the O
building O
permit O
. O

His O
neighbour O
Emil B-PER
Gensler I-PER
had O
already O
tried O
a O
standard O
control O
procedure O
for O
the O
construction O
plan O
380 O
about O
two O
years O
ago O
. O

However O
, O
the O
dispute O
over O
the O
construction O
site O
in O
preferred O
slopes O
goes O
further O
back O
. O

A O
first O
plan O
of O
1983 O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
by O
the O
Magistrate O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
SPD B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
state O
government O
had O
complained O
of O
legal O
and O
formal O
errors O
in O
the O
application O
. O

Basically O
, O
Greens B-ORG
and O
SPD B-ORG
refused O
to O
open O
the O
site O
for O
a O
few O
" O
luxury O
houses O
" O
expensive O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
keep O
the O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
as O
part O
of O
a O
green O
axis O
between O
Seckbach B-LOC
, O
the O
nature O
reserve O
" O
Hungerbach B-LOC
" O
and O
Berger B-LOC
Hang I-LOC
. O

When O
the O
CDU B-ORG
then O
also O
ruled O
in O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
, O
the O
magistrate O
presented O
a O
second O
plan O
, O
which O
was O
hardly O
different O
from O
the O
first O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
before O
the O
parliamentary O
elections O
and O
the O
subsequent O
change O
of O
government O
, O
the O
Hessian B-MISC
interior O
minister O
blessed O
the O
construction O
plan O
380 O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
it O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
built O
is O
due O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
the O
complex O
relocation O
procedure O
for O
the O
area O
: O

The O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
consists O
of O
many O
small O
parcels O
, O
which O
run O
as O
narrow O
strips O
in O
north O
- O
south O
direction O
. O

An O
exception O
here O
is O
the O
mentioned O
approximately O
1060 O
square O
meters O
plot O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
area O
, O
on O
which O
already O
stands O
a O
concrete O
foundation O
. O

The O
owners O
therefore O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
relocation O
, O
but O
could O
start O
construction O
already O
now O
. O

From O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
the O
workers O
there O
swirled O
heavily O
on O
dust O
, O
which O
is O
why O
Klaus B-PER
Boller I-PER
was O
able O
to O
effect O
a O
construction O
stop O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Already O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
he O
had O
filed O
an O
objection O
to O
the O
building O
permit O
after O
he O
had O
seen O
it O
a O
few O
days O
before O
. O

The O
tax O
man O
, O
who O
had O
been O
fighting O
from O
the O
outset O
against O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
wildcats O
, O
noticed O
several O
so O
- O
called O
exemptions O
from O
the O
original O
plan O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
requirement O
not O
to O
build O
row O
houses O
, O
the O
builders O
on O
the O
property O
concerned O
may O
also O
deviate O
from O
the O
prescribed O
number O
of O
floors O
( O
GRZ O
) O
and O
the O
number O
of O
floors O
( O
GFZ O
) O
. O

These O
values O
give O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
built O
land O
area O
and O
the O
area O
of O
all O
rooms O
of O
a O
house O
to O
the O
number O
of O
square O
meters O
of O
the O
entire O
building O
site O
. O

The O
approved O
ground O
and O
floor O
area O
figures O
were O
raised O
in O
the O
building O
permit O
by O
40 O
and O
44 O
percent O
respectively O
compared O
to O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
B O
380 O
. O

This O
means O
, O
simplified O
, O
that O
a O
larger O
part O
of O
the O
land O
will O
be O
built O
than O
originally O
envisaged O
. O

With O
his O
fear O
that O
with O
these O
liberations O
the O
foundation O
stone O
is O
laid O
for O
a O
dense O
construction O
of O
the O
whole O

Klaus B-PER
Boller I-PER
is O
not O
alone O
. O

Also O
some O
of O
his O

and O
local O
politicians O
suspect O
that O
it O
will O
be O
nothing O
with O
the O

of O

considers O
in O
the O
exemption O
, O
which O
allows O
on O
this O
section O
row O

an O
exception O
. O

The O
long O
ground O
floor O
of O
the O
area O
has O
offered O
itself O
" O
accidentally O
" O
for O
there O
to O
build O
a O
" O
long O
stretched O
structure O
" O
, O
explained O
by O
guards B-PER
. O

Without O
the O
release O
only O
one O
house O
could O
have O
stood O
there O
, O
but O
due O
to O
the O
size O
of O
the O
building O
site O
several O
houses O
would O
have O
been O
appropriate O
. O

However O
, O
these O
conditions O
did O
not O
generally O
apply O
to O
the O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
, O
but O
only O
to O
this O
small O
section O
. O

The O
two O
other O
exemptions O
for O
the O
ground O
and O
the O
number O
of O
shots O
had O
been O
approved O
due O
to O
a O
" O
computer O
error O
, O
" O
the O
official O
also O
said O
. O

It O
was O
erroneously O
assumed O
that O
the O
ratio O
of O
buildings O
to O
land O
area O
differed O
from O
the O
construction O
plan O
. O

However O
, O
both O
figures O
are O
still O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
plan O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
exemption O
fees O
wrongly O
levied O
should O
be O
refunded O

Greens B-ORG
about O
the O

" O

In O
principle O
Kleinert B-PER
believes O
that O
Western O
party O
democracies O
have O
produced O
an O
increasingly O
differentiated O
, O
highly O
complex O
network O
of O
institutions O
. O

In O
this O
, O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
actions O
a O
variety O
of O
different O
actors O
produces O
a O
growing O
inflexibility O
of O
the O
overall O
system O
. O
" O

Encouragingly O
, O
one O
could O
say O
: O

An O
increasing O
number O
of O
stakeholders O
produces O
more O
and O
more O
noise O
at O
the O
various O
levels O
of O
politics O
, O
administration O
and O
jurisprudence O
. O

Relatively O
little O
is O
achieved O
in O
the O
matter O
by O
the O
increasing O
volume O
. O

Because O
this O
is O
the O
case O
, O
politics O
is O
increasingly O
fleeing O
into O
symbolism O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
contradicts O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
media O
democracy O
. O

Instead O
of O
actions O
, O
the O
demonstration O
of O
thoughtfulness O
, O
the O
assurance O
that O
the O
problem O
will O
be O
taken O
seriously O

Kleinert B-PER
sees O
in O
the O
development O
he O
has O
sketched O
also O
a O
backside O
of O
the O
democratization O
chub O
, O
which O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
has O
produced O
a O
considerable O
gain O
in O
freedom O
of O
decision O
for O
the O
individual O
. O

Politics O
have O
made O
it O
harder O
to O
legitimize O
itself O
, O
the O
willingness O
to O
accept O
fragically O
decisions O
of O
superior O
authorities O
has O
declined O
. O

Also O
the O
meaning O
of O
" O
formalized O
social O
relations O
" O
, O
i.e. O
parties O
, O
trade O
unions O
or O
even O
associations O
, O
is O
declining O
. O

According O
to O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
the O
weakness O
in O
the O
design O
of O
politics O
is O
also O
the O
price O
that O
Western O
societies O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
high O
degree O
of O
pluralism O
of O
interests O
, O
opinions O
and O
lifestyles O
. O
" O

The O
question O
is O
essentially O
whether O
, O
under O
the O
difficult O
conditions O
of O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
level O
of O
democratization O
of O
the O
1980s O
can O
be O
maintained O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
shortage O
of O
personalities O
who O
have O
stuck O
, O
too O
many O
politicians O
seemed O
interchangeable O
, O
" O
a O
bit O
like O
politicians O
from O
the O
stick O
, O
" O
Kleinert B-PER
writes O
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
also O
a O
mirror O
image O
of O
society O
, O
because O
such O
complaints O
would O
also O
exist O
in O
other O
professions O
, O
in O
sports O
, O
in O
the O
arts O
and O
in O
the O
economy O
. O
" O

Certainly O
, O
" O
Kleinert B-PER
said O
, O
" O
the O
leadership O
of O
the O
political O
staff O
has O
declined O
, O
while O
the O
jealousy O
of O
the O
individual O
actors O
has O
increased O
. O
" O

With O
an O
increasing O
tendency O
, O
politicians O
tended O
to O
draw O
their O
judgments O
about O
themselves O
and O
their O
political O
performance O
solely O
from O
their O
mirror O
image O
in O
the O
media O
. O

The O
necessary O
to O
quick O
shots O

spectacles O
, O
which O
sometimes O
makes O
some O
whirlwinds O
, O
but O
then O
also O
often O
quickly O
forgotten O
again O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
liberal O
zeitgeist O
comes O
with O

are O

of O
the O
chaotic O
beam O

In O
the O
1920s O
, O
they O
were O
thrown O
on O
the O
coastal O
cliffs O
, O
using O
the O
fertility O
symbol O
of O
the O
burning O
sea O
as O
a O
blanket O
. O

For O
an O
aseptic O
note O
it O
was O
done O
to O
the O
German B-MISC
erotic O
photographers O
in O
the O
30s O
: O

The O
free O
body O
culture O
offered O
here O
the O
unnecessary O
reason O
, O
as O
forced O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
produce O
dignified O
body O
images O
. O

Up O
to O
the O
most O
shameless O
, O
aggressive O
images O
of O
the O
current O
act O
photography O
, O
however O
, O
some O
commonalities O
of O
this O
genre O
can O
be O
found O
. O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
the O
body O
is O
used O
as O
a O
solid O
material O
, O
sometimes O
as O
an O
entire O
action O
figure O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
fragmented O
body O
landscape O
. O

The O
desire O
of O
the O
performers O
plays O
almost O
no O
role O
- O
what O
these O
pictures O
repeatedly O
reveal O
, O
are O
rather O
the O
fantasies O
of O
the O
lighting O
artists O
, O
projected O
on O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

And O
that O
's O
not O
always O
particularly O
fantastic O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
evident O
in O
the O
historical O
distance O
. O

The O
pornographic O
images O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
photography O
, O
around O
1850 O
, O
appear O
only O
as O
pictures O
of O
their O
time O
, O
hardly O
as O
erotic O
photographs O
. O

In O
an O
overwhelming O
jumble O
, O
the O
unbleached O
models O
are O
illuminated O
, O
whereas O
the O
long O
exposure O
times O
the O
somewhat O
wooden O
poses O
should O
have O
been O
reinforced O
even O
more O
. O

The O
shameful O
and O
repulsive O
voyeurism O
experience O
of O
the O
viewer O
is O
the O
actual O
aim O
of O
these O
pictures O
- O
their O
design O
secondary O
. O

The O
desire O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
picture O
then O
. O

The O
partly O
drastic O
stagings O
of O
newer O
dates O
are O
mostly O
aimed O
at O
the O
same O
old O
effects O
. O

There O
it O
is O
relaxing O
to O
see O
alternatives O
to O
these O
fractured O
beauties O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
breast O
image O
of O
Gundula B-PER
Schulze I-PER
stands O
far O
from O
common O
ideals O
. O

An O
old O
lady O
, O
horrified O
, O
somewhat O
insecure O
, O
but O
very O
seriously O
glancing O
at O
the O
camera O
. O

The O
direct O
look O
out O
of O
the O
picture O
makes O
us O
scared O
to O
confront O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
Voyeur O
. O

And O
so O
the O
woman O
appears O
as O
a O
noble O
portrait O
, O
as O
a O
character O
study O
, O
not O
an O
object O
of O
desire O
. O

Similar O
to O
the O
old O
couple O
, O
the O
spouse O
Jan B-PER
Bengtsson I-PER
held O
in O
tender O

Scheidt B-PER

he O

selection O

compiled O

He O
honors O
art O
claims O
he O
fortunately O
does O
not O
make O
. O

The O

That O

The O
routine O
of O
the O

" O

" O

In O
1982 O
, O
parents O

decided O
to O
do O
something O
against O
the O
miserable O
conditions O
at O
the O

Too O
small O
spaces O

were O
the O
main O
criticisms O

Although O

only O
two O

a O

for O
a O

stood O

After O

was O

a O

His O
reasoning O
- O
as O
quoted O
by O
the O

" O

: O

" O
He O
feared O
that O
the O
Frankfurters B-MISC
might O
have O
an O
adverse O
influence O
on O
the O
Offenbachers B-MISC

" O

That O
was O
certainly O
not O
a O
wrong O
thought O
at O
that O
troubled O
time O
. O

And O
it O
should O
confirm O
itself O
: O

On O
March O
8 O
, O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
neighbouring O
town O
held O
a O
protest O
assembly O
, O
stormed O
the O
railway O
station O
and O
began O
passenger O
traffic O
with O
self O
- O
elected O
personnel O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
April O
of O
the O
same O
year O
that O
there O
were O
proper O
fares O
and O
shepherds O
. O

In O
1875 O
the O
line O
was O
shortened O
and O
the O
local B-LOC
station I-LOC
was O
converted O
to O
the O
main B-LOC
station I-LOC
. O

But O
under O
" O
full O
steam O
" O
the O
development O
went O
forward O
: O

The O
locomotives O
of O
the O
local O
railway O
only O
got O
competition O
nine O
years O
later O

and O
electric O
. O

In O
1884 O
, O
one O
of O
the O
first O

the O

. O

As O
early O
as O
1901 O
it O
was O
called O

it O
was O
no O

Finally O
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
the O
favourable O
route O
of O
the O

through O

which O
led O
to O
the O
final O
out O

the O

it O

just O
about O

In O
the O

Every O

it O
serves O
the O

the O

. O

The O
members O
want O
to O
make O
some O
advertising O
for O
the O
club O
- O
but O
also O
to O
get O
to O
know O
each O
other O
the O

In O
the O
morning O
the O

in O
the O

of O

They O
hit O

The O
highlight O
was O
this O

the O

of O
the O
Taekwon O

, O
which O
only O

Since O
the O

, O
much O
has O
changed O
in O
the O

The O

got O
an O

a O

about O

at O

meeting O

The O
results O
of O

now O
be O
presented O
to O
citizens O
in O

, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
demanded O
in O
a O
motion O
: O

In O
questionnaires O
distributed O
during O
the O
hearing O
, O
residents O
could O
express O
their O
opinion O
and O
decide O
on O
one O
of O
the O

The O
numbering O
of O

bows O

ensure O
that O

out O

This O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
argue O
, O
will O
not O
delay O
traffic O
in O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
any O
longer O
. O

Even O
in O

, O

The O
CDU B-ORG
, O
the O
largest O
group O
in O
the O
local B-ORG
council I-ORG
9 I-ORG
, O
does O
not O
want O
to O
know O
about O
this O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
, O
only O
a O
more O
sophisticated O
procedure O
can O
guarantee O
that O
the O
process O
proceeds O
democratically O
. O

Every O
inhabitant O
around O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
should O
receive O
a O
questionnaire O
explaining O
the O
variants O
. O

For O
even O
those O
who O
can O
not O
come O
to O
the O

should O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
cast O
their O

Günther B-PER

" O

There O
is O
a O
very O
random O
majority O

" O

The O
Greens B-ORG
emphasise O
another O
practical O
point O
: O

" O
We O
have O
been O
discussing O
the O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
for O
years O
and O
you O
believe O
you O
can O
present O
the O
matter O
in O
a O
few O
lines O
on O
the O
questionnaire O
, O
" O
said O
local O
councillor O
Freya B-PER
Linder I-PER
of O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

And O
that O
is O
for O
good O
reason O
: O

Because O
even O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
first O
zone O
in O
the O
district O
, O
the O
working O
group O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
formulations O
for O
such O
a O
bow O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
pretended O
not O
to O
be O
neutral O
and O
to O
want O
to O
manipulate O
the O
inhabitants O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
project O
was O
taken O
jointly O
by O
the O
SPD B-ORG
, O
FDP B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
. O

This O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
majority O

looked O
different O

Günther B-PER
Görtz I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
, O
Zünglein O
on O
the O
scale O
, O
agreed O
with O
the O
CDU B-ORG
. O

The O
variants O
for O
Kurhessenstraße B-LOC
are O
, O
in O
his O
opinion O
, O
easier O
to O
explain O
than O
the O
three O
variants O
for O
the O
first O
zone O
. O

In O
addition O
: O

" O
If O
people O
still O
have O
questions O
, O
they O
can O
come O
to O
the O

the O

form O

Each O

A O
survey O

only O
allowed O

: O

Producing O

have O
priority O
over O
administrative O

their O
glass O

- O
" O
because O
they O
displace O
all O

" O

" O
Simultaneously O
" O
but O
the O
urban O
planners O
" O
want O
to O
protect O
existing O
residential O
buildings O
" O
. O

In O
the O

the O

should O
therefore O
only O
be O
allowed O
" O

Also O

All O
grey O

Whether O
it O
can O
actually O
be O
implemented O
, O
remains O
in O
the O
stars O
. O

Work O
is O
being O
done O
at O
some O
points O
in O
the O
industrial B-LOC

but O
the O
big O
concept O

awaiting O

Similarly O
it O
looks O
in O
the O
residential O
quarter O
Lötzener B-LOC

In O

the O

wanted O
to O

the O

but O
has O
done O
nothing O

So O
it O
may O

take O
until O

becomes O
an O

the O

Hisis B-PER
hopes O
that O
this O
will O
change O
soon O
: O

" O
We O
are O
in O
talks O
with O
an O
insurance O
agency O
that O
could O
take O
on O
at O
least O
fifty O
percent O
of O
the O
financing O
. O
" O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
work O
, O
the O
necessary O
money O
must O
come O
from O
the O

' O
contributions O

each O
of O
the O

and O
60 O

100 O

and O

from O
the O
entrance O

games O
of O
three O
marks O
. O

Through O
advertising O
posters O
, O
the O
club O
tries O
to O
attract O
spectators O
. O

However O
, O
they O
have O
to O
go O
to O
Niederrad B-LOC
, O
because O
on O
the O
hard O
pitch O
there O
of O
the O
Union B-ORG

carries O
out O

The O

, O
has O
not O
lost O
anything O
in O
performance O
despite O
numerous O
departures O
, O
Hisis B-PER
says O

Finally O
, O
we O
have O
strengthened O
with O
a O
total O
of O
nine O

from O

from O

. O

And O
the O
enthusiasm O
is O
great O
, O
he O
stresses O
. O
" O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
also O
an O
advantage O
that O
we O
are O
the O
only O
Turkish B-MISC
team O
in O
the O
league O
and O
we O
have O
no O
one O

" O
he O
complains O
to O
the O
good O

For O
the O
necessary O
gates O
should O

but O
very O
curious O

Soon O
it O
will O
be O

whether O

continue O

The O

an O

Nevertheless O
, O

that O
the O

puts O
a O
good O

according O
to O
the O
motto O

because O
the O

was O
successfully O
beaten O
in O
the O
hurdle O
speed O
through O
the O
preparatory O
games O
. O

And O
to O
this O
day O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
150 O
members O
believes O
that O
a O
national O
club O
name O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
as O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
league O
rival O
Dubrovnik B-ORG
or O
the O
AC B-ORG
Mladost I-ORG
( O
formerly O
Jugo B-ORG

This O
changes O
, O
and O
Cucak B-PER
is O
particularly O
sad O
about O
it O
, O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
sponsors O
have O
withdrawn O

( O
the O
promised O

The O

therefore O
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
jubilee O
celebration O
planned O
for O
the O
association O

20th O
anniversary O
in O
October O

" O

We O
really O
do O

have O
many O
reasons O
to O
celebrate O

Since O
it O
is O
already O
a O
great O
pleasure O
that O
the O

" O

" O

But O
even O
the O
best O
training O
and O
the O
greatest O
experience O
sometimes O
does O
not O
serve O
much O
, O
because O
the O
animals O
are O
subject O
to O
as O
well O
as O
the O
human O
performance O

" O

Especially O
in O
the O

, O
sometimes O
the O

are O
completely O
out O

" O
says O
Müller B-PER

For O
example O
, O
some O
animals O
had O
performed O
much O
better O
in O
the O
preliminary O
decisions O
. O

For O
the O
dogs O
such O
a O
competition O
also O
brings O
with O
it O
much O
unknown O
, O
because O
the O
shepherd O
and O
his O
dogs O
do O
not O
know O
the O
herd O
. O

There O
can O
already O
happen O
that O
the O
herd O
becomes O
nervous O
and O
suddenly O
drives O
the O
dogs O
. O

This O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
church B-LOC

, O
but O
also O
considerable O
achievements O
were O
demanded O
by O
the O
shepherds O

If O
, O
for O

, O
a O
herd O
of O
about O
320 O

runs O
on O

just O
barely O
three O

apart O
on O
a O
stretch O

300 O

has O
to O
be O
held O

. O

In O

the O

whispered O
about O

In O
the O
mid-1970s O
, O
the O

at O

it O

The O

" O
- O
a O
wisdom O
that O
is O
not O
always O
true O
. O

Regarding O
the O
renewal O
of O
heating O
systems O
but O
it O
certainly O
meets O
: O

The O
past O
few O
years O
have O
led O
to O
new O
insights O
and O
serious O
improvements O
in O
heating O
technology O
. O

Who O
at O
home O
still O
uses O
a O
heating O
system O
older O
construction O
year O
, O
should O
be O
able O
to O
calculate O
by O
a O
specialist O
once O
, O
how O
much O
energy O
and O
thus O
money O
he O
can O
save O
with O
a O
new O
, O
contemporary O
system O
. O

If O
the O
boiler O
is O
older O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
it O
is O
highly O
likely O
to O
have O
a O
savings O
potential O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
percent O
. O

If O
you O
add O
that O
, O
as O
a O
rule O
, O
the O
maintenance O
cost O
of O
a O
new O
plant O
decreases O
significantly O
, O
the O
investment O
will O
be O
amortized O
within O
a O
few O
years O
. O

But O
there O
is O
another O
valid O
argument O
: O

On O
30 O
September O
1993 O
, O
the O
transitional O
period O
of O
the O
first O
Federal O
Regulation O
on O
the O
Protection O
of O
Immigration O
expires O
. O

At O
the O
latest O
from O
this O
point O
onwards O
, O
old O
plants O
must O
also O
comply O
with O
the O
new O
, O
significantly O
tightened O
limit O
values O
. O

Lower O
energy O
consumption O
means O
an O
increased O
use O
of O
fuels O
. O

This O
automatically O
reduces O
the O
production O
of O
pollutants O

The O

, O

Whoever O
thinks O
bad O
about O

does O
not O

In O

I O
sit O

with O

Schwejk B-PER

However O
, O
not O
only O
at O
the O

I O
am O
confronted O
with O
the O

which O
the O

The O

For O

Even O
as O
the O
crown O
of O
a O
bottle O
basket O
it O
is O
to O
have O
. O

The O
Hasek B-PER
would O
probably O
have O
drunk O
with O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
bottle O
and O
put O
some O
so O
suffocating O
sentences O
in O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
Schwejk B-PER
that O
they O
would O
have O
taken O
him O
immediately O
any O
advertising O
value O
in O
their O
infinite O
matching O
certainty O
. O

Now O
the O
gay B-PER
does O
n't O
only O
meet O
me O
as O
a O
kitty O
figure O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
most O
serious O

of O
the O
most O
serious O
German B-MISC

bodies O
he O
appears O
again O
and O
again O
to O
characterize O
the O
customs O
in O
my O
host O
country O
illuminatingly O
. O

Most O
often O
he O
is O
called O
together O
with O
a O
certain O
gentleman O
Kafka B-PER
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
had O
a O
slightly O
different O

view O
and O
in O
the O

supposed O
to O
have O

lived O
. O

Such O

I O
went O

over O

Sometimes O
I O

thought O

there O
he O
is O

the O

But O
when O
you O
take O
a O
closer O
look O
, O
he O
always O
finds O
himself O
as O
a O
human O
being O
like O
you O

I. O

Especially O
strange O
it O
was O
always O
, O
of O

, O
when O
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
Bohemian B-MISC
Schwejks B-PER
in O
Bausch O
and O
Bogen O
was O
attributed O
to O
all O
citizens O
of O
the O
CSFR B-ORG
. O

At O
least O
the O
Slovaks B-MISC
seem O
to O
have O
put O
an O
end O
to O
this O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
with O
their O
hard O
to O
overlook O
demand O
for O
independence O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
has O
created O
a O
sensitive O
gap O
for O
international O
journalism O

Relief O
is O
in O

however O

There O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
last O
century O
a O
Slovak B-MISC
Robin B-PER

who O
took O
the O
rich O

the O
rough O

Tatra O
to O
give O
to O
the O
poor O
. O

The O
Hungarian B-MISC
lords O
of O
Slovakia B-LOC
finally O
caught O
up O
with O
him O
. O

Janosik B-PER
was O
the O
name O
of O
the O
folk O
hero O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
know O
that O
the O
Czech B-MISC
saying B-PER
of O
the O
" O
Slovakian B-MISC
Janosics B-PER
" O
is O
not O
very O
well O
heard O
among O
the O
so O

called O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
bring O
it O
to O
the O
discussion O
of O
simplicity O
half O
but O
as O
a O
Schwejk B-MISC
substitute I-MISC
. O

The O
brave O

still O
remain O

. O

Anyway O
, O
the O

at O
our O
daily O

now O
always O
looks O
at O
me O
so O
spoiled O

" O

For O

I O

A O
controversial O
" O
shape O
" O
of O
scientific O
life O
: O

the O
structuralism O
, O
has O
become O
old O
. O

Historians O
and O
biographers O
swarm O
out O
and O
paint O
their O
grey O

grey O
, O
with O
which O
, O
as O

says O
, O
nothing O
more O
" O

" O
, O
but O
only O
something O
" O
recognizes O
" O
. O

Ask O
yourself O
, O
however O
, O
what O
is O
the O
best O
way O
of O
knowing O
- O
the O
epoch O
of O
structuralism O
or O
the O
history O
of O

Monographic O

since O
followed O
the O
development O
of O
individual O
disciplines O
or O
the O
development O
of O
their O

predecessors O
. O

But O
what O
was O
lacking O
until O
now O
was O
a O
comprehensive O
history O
of O
this O
movement O
, O
which O
in O
France B-LOC
since O
the O
1950s O
has O
experienced O
all O
the O
humanities O
and O
methodically O
revolutionized O
. O

Such O
global O
access O
, O
however O
, O
presents O
problems O
that O
individual O
studies O
do O
not O
know O
. O

Any O
uniform O
, O
continuous O
treatment O
of O
such O
a O
diverse O
phenomenon O
seems O
impossible O
, O
because O
structuralism O
was O
initially O
an O
epoch O
that O
, O
like O
any O
other O
, O
has O
hardly O
any O
precise O
limits O
. O

, O
it O
would O
be O

still O

Were O

who O

The O
author O
had O
to O
develop O
a O
very O
own O
biographical O
concept O
, O
because O
he O
knew O
exactly O

about O

mysterious O
and O

, O

Too O
much O
comes O
together O
here O
. O

Althusser B-PER
was O
apparently O
a O
man O
without O
characteristics O
, O
who O
, O
however O
, O
as O
a O
professor O
of O
philosophy O
and O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
, O
could O
rise O
to O
an O
intellectual O
myth O
. O

But O
he O
was O
also O
a O
mentally O
ill O
man O
whose O
life O
ended O
in O
a O
tragedy O
. O

His O
biographer O
sees O
his O
task O
in O
confronting O
this O
myth O
with O
the O
biographical O
reality O
to O
destroy O
it O
. O

By O
means O
of O
diverse O
, O
new O
sources O
, O
he O
carefully O
tries O
to O
penetrate O
the O
imaginary O
world O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
slaughtered O
his O
wife O
. O

On O
500 O
pages O
he O
passes O
through O
that O
time O
, O
in O
which O
Althusser B-PER
was O
still O
completely O
unknown O
and O
in O
which O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
the O
mystery O
must O
lie O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Algerian B-MISC
childhood O
, O
who O
has O
been O
thoroughly O
poisoned O
by O
an O
anti O
- O
body O
mother O

torn O
, O
brilliant O
brother O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
whom O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
marry O
! O

Thus O
, O
the O
child O
was O
already O
compelled O
by O
the O
tormenting O
, O
life O
- O
changing O
insight O
to O
have O
no O

not O

This O

The O

The O

If O
you O

you O
have O
to O
file O
a O

The O

The O

he O
must O
ensure O
that O
the O

find O
the O

The O

If O

then O
the O

the O

not O
change O

the O

The O
German B-MISC
press O
has O
reported O
so O
far O
mainly O
on O
the O

cities O
of O
Sarajevo B-LOC

It O
is O
not O

how O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
people O
in O
these O
cities O
could O
be O
improved O
by O

, O
everything O

must O
be O
done O
to O
save O
the O
lives O
of O
the O
defenseless O
, O
i.e. O
women O
, O
children O
, O
old O
people O
, O
wounded O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
to O
bring O
food O
to O
these O
people O
, O
to O
then O
leave O
them O
in O
the O
hail O
of O
the O
shelves O
, O
while O
you O
go O
back O
to O
the O
safe O
subway O
yourself O
. O

How O
should O
such O
an O
action O
be O
dealt O
with O
at O
all O
? O

An O
auxiliary O
convoy O
approaches O
, O
for O

, O
the O
city O
of O
Gorazde B-LOC
, O
while O
this O
is O
exposed O
to O
a O

Should O
the O

now O
stop O
the O
fire O
until O
the O

has O
been O
delivered O
, O
or O
should O
the O
convoy O
wait O
until O
the O
committee O
ends O
at O
some O
point O
? O

Both O
seem O
unrealistic O
. O

There O
is O
therefore O
only O
one O
way O
to O
provide O
humanitarian O
aid O
. O

All O
defenceless O
persons O
must O
be O
granted O
free O
departure O
to O
a O
safe O
place O

Everything O
else O
is O
no O
help O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
want O
the O
free O
deportation O
of O
women O
and O
children O
at O
all O
. O

They O
may O
reject O
it O
because O
it O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
renunciation O
of O
the O
land O
claimed O
by O
them O
. O

It O
would O
be O
appreciated O
if O
you O
would O
report O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Bosnians B-MISC
will O
also O
ask O
who O
feeds O
the O
soldiers O
if O
the O
women O
and O
children O
are O
no O
longer O
there O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
humanitarian O
aid O
for O
civilians O
at O
all O
. O

The O
soldiers O
will O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
also O
for O
them O
something O
remains O
, O
probably O
even O
the O
larger O
proportion O
. O

This O
means O
the O
supply O
of O
food O
to O
support O
a O
leading O
party O
in O
the O
war O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
will O
accept O
this O
. O

We O
can O
only O
help O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
by O
proposing O
a O
treaty O
, O
both O
for O
them O
and O
for O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
, O
which O
will O
allow O
the O
civilian O
population O
in O
the O
conflict O
areas O
to O
move O
freely O
and O
safely O
to O
a O
safe O
place O
. O

There O
are O
no O

options O

A O

if O

and O
we O

some O

not O

the O
game O
, O
but O
still O
decides O
on O
the O
result O
of O
the O
game O
. O

This O
then O
precipitates O
just O
the O
catastrophic O
consequences O
mentioned O
above O
, O
because O
whoever O
without O
his O

just O
because O

or O
an O

who O

In O
order O
to O
relieve O
legislators O
and O
the O
family O

of O
responsibility O
for O
these O
consequences O
, O
the O

should O
now O
hold O
. O

But O
if O
already O
before O
, O
even O
before O
a O
parent O
pair O
seeks O
help O
with O
a O
mediator O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O

remain O
independent O
of O
the O

with O
the O

and O
the O

then O
the O

just O
nothing O

a O

of O

from O
the O

The O
purpose O
of O
the O
mediation O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
to O
appease O
the O
" O

to O
accept O
the O

The O

thus O
reduce O
its O

the O

Until O

, O
Berlin B-LOC
had O
a O

a O
bank O
run O
by O
a O

. O

Since O
then O
, O
the O
country O
has O
had O
to O
pump O

into O
the O
two O
competing O

. O

Their O

with O
the O
advancement O
of O
the O
all O

offer O
and O
the O

new O

. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
new O
EC B-MISC
directives I-MISC
require O
significant O
increases O
in O
capital O
expenditure O
. O

The O
model O
recently O
presented O
by O
the O
Senate O
wants O
to O
take O
into O
account O
all O
the O
requirements O
. O

However O
, O
there O
was O
a O
mixed O
reaction O
in O
specialist O
circles O
, O
because O
it O
contained O
many O
political O
considerations O
and O
was O
not O
conclusive O
in O
itself O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
the O
holding O
company O
acts O
as O
an O
independent O
bank O
, O
but O
that O
under O
its O
existing O
credit O
institutions O
should O
" O
first O
retain O
their O
identity O
and O
legal O
form O
" O
. O

Critics O
also O
regard O
as O
unproven O
the O
thesis O
that O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
strong O
public O
- O
law O

group O
will O
strengthen O
the O

They O
ask O
that O
finally O

The O
competition O
in O
the O

The O
22 O

- O
old O
Wladik B-PER
had O
volunteered O
to O
join O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
military O
at O
the O

April O
in O
order O
to O
" O
defend O

in O
the O
mountain B-LOC

Karabakh I-LOC
region O
, O
which O
was O
contested O
by O
Armenians B-MISC
and O
Azerbaijanis O
, O
as O
the O
father O
says O
. O

When O
the O
friends O
volunteered O
, O
however O
, O
he O
could O
not O
stand O
there O
as O
a O
fool O
. O
" O

The O
Alimows B-PER
are O
actually O
Russians B-MISC
, O
but O
have O
been O
living O
and O
working O
in O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
capital O
Baku B-LOC
for O
decades O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
May O
Alimov B-PER
had O
learned O
about O
the O
International B-ORG
Red I-ORG
Cross I-ORG
that O
his O
son O
had O
been O
taken O
prisoner O
of O
war O
in O
Armenia B-MISC
two O
weeks O
earlier O
. O

Since O
this O
news O
arrived O
, O
he O
is O
looking O
for O
him O
. O

Neither O
the O
defense O
nor O
the O
interior B-ORG

feels O
responsible O
for O
prisoners O
of O
war O

” O

No O

the O

" O
complains O
the O

But O
the O
53 O

- O
old O
crane O
driver O
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

He O
gathered O
his O

left O
his O

and O
began O
leaving O
the O
battalions O
on O
both O
sides O

the O

" O

With O
the O
troops O
I O
learned O
a O
lot O
more O
. O
" O

There O
were O
lists O
of O
injured O
and O
dead O
. O
" O

I O
counted O
a O
total O
of O
1700 O
soldiers O
and O
5000 O
civilians O
on O
the O
lists O
during O
my O
trip O
, O
" O
says O
Alimov B-PER
. O

These O
are O
, O
however O
, O
only O
the O
numbers O
of O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
who O
have O
been O
imprisoned O
in O
Armenia B-MISC
. O

Thanks O
to O
his O
tenacity O
, O
Alimov B-PER
finally O
reached O
the O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
border O
guard O
in O
Kasach B-LOC
that O
his O
son O
was O
scheduled O
for O
a O
prisoner O
exchange O
. O
" O

Together O
with O
four O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
and O
a O
woman O
, O
he O
should O
be O
exchanged O
for O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
. O
" O

But O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
out O
. O

As O
Alimov B-PER
found O
out O
, O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
is O
with O
an O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
family O
that O
keeps O
him O
in O
prison O
to O
organize O
an O
exchange O
against O
his O
own O
son O
in O
Armenia B-LOC
. O

As O
this O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
is O
held O
by O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
family O
, O
which O
thus O
wants O
to O
free O
their O
own O
son O
from O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
captivity O
, O
the O
company O
failed O
. O

" O
Our O
governments O
are O
too O
young O
to O
have O
everything O
under O
control O
, O
" O
said O
Vladimir B-PER
Airapetjan I-PER
, O
KGB B-MISC
chief I-MISC
in O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
Border O
Guard O
of O
Yerevan B-LOC
, O
explaining O
the O
handling O
of O
prisoners O
of O
war O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

Agreements O
between O
the O
governments O
of O
Armenia B-LOC

Azerbaijan B-LOC
did O
not O
exist O

" O

The O

does O
not O
run O
at O

at O

Thus O

the O

Republic O
of O
Chechnya B-LOC

Kazakhstan I-LOC
on O

Villagers O

Between O
Kazakhstan B-LOC

there O
is O
also O
an O

That O
it O
can O
clap O

says O
the O

therefore O

When O

one O
wonders O
why O

the O

Kiev O
in O
Marinsky B-LOC
(= O
MarienTheater B-LOC
) O
changed O
due O
to O
the O
revolution O
of O
1917 O
. O

Also O
musically O
the O
recording O
seeks O
the O
compromise O
between O
incompatible O
positions O
and O
finds O
its O
own O
way O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
based O
, O
as O
was O
the O
case O
with O
Sony B-ORG
under O
the O
late O
Emil B-PER
Tchakarov I-PER
, O
on O
Schostakov B-PER

But O
it O
does O
not O
follow O
the O
in O
some O
detail O
. O

This O
was O
already O
the O
case O
in O
Claudio B-PER
Abbado I-PER
's I-PER
Vienna B-MISC
State I-MISC
Opera O
( O
German B-ORG

, O
where O
the O

had O
passed O
in O
Strawinsky B-PER

irrational O
editing O
of O

. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
ideologically O
open O
and O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
epic O
work O
is O
delicate O

Schostakovych B-PER

the O

: O

A O
harmonization O
by O
Zyklik O
, O
which O
certainly O
contradicts O
Mussorgski B-PER

historical O
picture O

now O
goes O
another O
way O
than O
Abbado B-PER
with O

fire B-MISC
magic I-MISC
by O
letting O
the O
final O
choir O
of O
the O
Old O
Believers O
follow O
a O
purely O
instrumental O
reprise O
: O

a O
convincing O
solution O
as O
in O
other O
detailed O
problems O
. O

Also O
musically O
Gergiew B-PER
goes O
his O
own O
way O
. O

He O
interprets O
the O
music O
as O
unequally O
introverted O
as O
Abbado B-PER
( O
which O
he O
avoids O
cuts O
) O
, O
turning O
the O
musical O
epic O
into O
a O
often O
chamber O
musical O
style O
. O

He O
can O
afford O
to O
renounce O
any O
theatre O
because O
his O
horns O
impress O
with O
a O
fantastic O
fine O
art O
. O

Also O
the O
soloist O
ensemble O
that O
does O
not O
have O
any O
borrowed O
star B-PER
convinces O
by O
the O
fine O
cut O
of O
its O
access O
. O

The O
absence O
of O
spectacular O
effects O
can O
also O
be O
observed O
in O
the O
sound O
technique O
of O
the O
recording O
made O
in O
the O
bitterest O
winter O
cold O
of O
1991 O
. O

Everything O
works O
, O
even O
with O
correspondingly O
turned O
volume O
controller O
, O
quiet O
, O
some O
also O
clearly O
away O
. O

It O
seems O
as O
if O
Gergiew B-PER
wants O
to O
show O
us O
an O
evil O
history O
from O
ancient O
times O
as O
a O
musical O
behind O
- O
the O
- O

. O

This O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O

of O

as O
an O

such O
as O
their O
ability O
to O

together O
and O
their O
group O

which O
they O
have O
learned O
on O

Carlos B-PER
has O
lived O
through O
the O
four O
stages O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the O
last O
of O
which O
is O
the O
Children O
's O
Republic O
, O
even O
once O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
is O
called O
" O
Friendship O
" O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
and O
his O
staff O
go O
to O
the O
children O
, O
called O
" O
produces O
" O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
, O
on O
the O
street O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
them O
. O

This O
is O
how O
the O
program O
fits O
the O
world O
of O
street O
children O
and O
not O
the O
other O
way O
around O
. O

First O
they O
observe O
the O
children O
. O

After O
the O
first O
contacts O
they O
finally O
start O
to O
play O
with O
each O
other O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
educators O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
have O
learned O
their O
own O
language O
of O
the O
" O
produces O
" O
who O
speak O
these O
in O
order O
to O
be O
better O
able O
to O
protect O
themselves O
on O
the O
road O
against O
others O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
they O
invite O
the O
children O
to O
an O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
, O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
a O
place O
where O
the O
children O
relax O
by O
swimming O
and O
playing O
and O
live O
a O
while O
without O
drugs O
. O

Approximately O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
approximately O
5,000 O
street O
children O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
use O
drugs O
. O

Many O
sniff O
cord O
glue O
, O
with O
which O
they O
strangle O
their O
nerves O
and O
hunger O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
however O
, O
is O
also O
taken O
" O
basuco O
" O
, O
a O
particularly O
dangerous O
mixture O
of O
the O
waste O
product O
of O
the O
coca O
plant O
, O
which O
is O
enriched O
with O
chemical O
additives O
. O

The O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
offers O
the O
employees O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
above O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
background O
to O
the O
street O
life O
of O
the O
children O
. O

All O
those O
responsible O
for O
the O
project O
agree O
that O
- O
like O
many O
other O
problems O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
- O
also O
the O
" O
produces O
" O
have O
their O
main O
cause O
in O
the O
social O
plight O
of O
many O
families O
. O

According O
to O
the O
1990 O
state O
statistics O
, O
38 O
percent O
of O
all O
Colombian B-MISC
households O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O
income O
to O
support O
themselves O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
families O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
country O
to O
the O
city O
. O

There O
, O
people O
are O
driven O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
educational O
prospects O
as O
well O
as O
a O
lack O
of O
medical O
care O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
but O
also O
the O
lack O
of O
own O
land O
and O
wages O
from O
which O
they O
can O
live O
, O
but O
above O
all O
also O
the O
persistent O
" O
violence O
" O
( O
violence O
) O
that O
still O
prevails O
there O
: O

Although O
the O
attacks O
of O
the O
drug O
mafia O
have O
decreased O
since O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
military O
army O
of O
the O
Medellín B-ORG
cartel I-ORG
last O
year O
, O
but O
in O
return O
the O
aggression O
between O
the O
military O
and O
rebels O
after O
unsuccessful O
negotiations O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
guerrilla O
at O
the O
moment O
resume O
. O

Many O
civilians O
are O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

In O
the O
city O
, O
however O
, O
the O
refugee O
families O
often O
find O
no O
work O
or O
only O
employment O
in O
the O
" O
informal O
sector O
" O
, O
so O
they O
are O
without O
regulated O
income O
. O

In O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
440 O
000 O
workers O
, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O
working O
population O
, O
earn O
less O
than O
the O
already O
very O
low O
minimum O
wage O
, O
according O
to O
the O
government O
's O
economic O
data O
. O

Often O
, O
therefore O
, O
both O
parents O
must O
work O
. O

The O
children O
either O
stay O
alone O
at O
home O
or O
go O
to O
the O
streets O
, O
where O
they O
contribute O
their O
own O
share O
of O
the O
family O
income O
by O
occasional O
work O
, O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Often O
they O
then O
join O
the O
street O
children O
and O
break O
up O
contact O
with O
the O
family O
because O
they O
feel O
exploited O
there O
and O
are O
often O
also O
mistreated O
. O
" O

85 O
percent O
of O
fathers O
punish O
their O
children O
, O
" O
explains O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
, O
responsible O
employee O
in O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
, O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
this O
behavior O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
social O
distress O
that O
leads O
to O
fathers O
' O
frustration O
and O
aggression O
, O
also O
an O
authoritarian O
style O
of O
education O
that O
has O
its O
roots O
in O
the O
long O
history O
of O
exploitation O
and O
slavery O
in O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
. O

About O
three O
quarters O
of O
the O
street O
children O
who O
participate O
in O
the O
excursion O
to O
Arvelaez O
, O
then O
regularly O
come O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
, O
a O
courtyard O
that O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
set O
up O
twelve O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
street O
children O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
gate O
of O
the O
farm O
, O
the O
" O
productes O
" O
give O
away O
their O
drugs O
and O
then O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

They O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
themselves O
, O
play O
football O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
get O
a O
doctor O
. O
" O

For O
eight O
days O
I O
've O
been O
coming O
to O
the O
patio O
, O
because O
here O
there O
is O
breakfast O
and O
lunch O
, O
" O
says O
the O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Julian B-PER
. O

He O
also O
became O
a O
street O
boy O
because O
he O
was O
beaten O
by O
his O
parents O
in O
the O
poor O
district O
of O
Santa B-LOC
Librada I-LOC
in O
the O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
. O

But O
like O
many O
others O
Julian B-PER
pulls O
back O
to O
the O
streets O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
" O
produces O
" O
have O
become O
accustomed O
to O
the O
" O
free O
life O
" O
there O
. O

This O
desire O
for O
freedom O
is O
respected O
by O
the O
employees O
of O
Bosconia B-MISC
, O
because O
in O
the O
open O
institution O
one O
wants O
to O
take O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
children O
seriously O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
programme O
- O
whose O
name O
" O
Freedom O
" O
already O
indicates O
this O
- O
the O
children O
can O
go O
away O
again O
. O

But O
here O
they O
already O
have O
to O
comply O
with O
very O
specific O
rules O
, O
for O
example O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
and O
to O
have O
conversations O
with O
the O
responsible O
. O

Like O
the O
staff O
of O
the O
project O
during O
the O
first O
attempts O
to O
get O
closer O
to O
the O
children O
on O
the O
street O
, O
it O
is O
also O
attempted O
here O
first O
, O
to O
bring O
the O
children O
back O
to O
their O
families O
. O

Because O
" O
the O
best O
institution O
is O
the O
true O
family O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
and O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
are O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

However O
, O
they O
make O
the O
experience O
that O
the O
children O
usually O
return O
there O
only O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
then O
they O
come O
back O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
. O

They O
start O
again O
from O
the O
front O
, O
what O
those O
who O
once O
left O
have O
to O
do O
for O
educational O
reasons O
. O
" O

Usually O
a O
child O
leaves O
the O
program O
three O
times O
until O
it O
really O
knows O
this O
, O
Carlos B-PER
again O
points O
out O
that O
the O
" O
produces O
" O
have O
not O
learned O
to O
appreciate O
freedom O
on O
the O
streets O
. O

In O
the O
third O
stage O
, O
which O
is O
called O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
the O
children O
then O
finally O
draw O
a O
line O
under O
their O
past O
. O

As O
a O
symbolic O
gesture O
for O
this O
, O
they O
solemnly O
burn O
their O
candlestick O
clothes O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
understands O
this O
stage O
as O
a O
playful O
introduction O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Now O
the O
children O
go O
to O
school O
regularly O
and O
learn O
handicrafts O
in O
a O
workshop O
and O
in O
ceramic O
crucibles O
. O

When O
the O
caregivers O
finally O
gain O
the O
impression O
that O
a O
child O
has O
become O
mature O
, O
it O
moves O
to O
the O
children O
's O
republic O
" O
La B-LOC
Florida I-LOC
" O
, O
where O
currently O
355 O
young O
people O
live O
, O
study O
and O
work O
. O

While O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
first O
stages O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
's O
program O
are O
located O
in O
the O
center O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
where O
most O
street O
children O
live O
, O
" O

Florida I-LOC
" O
is O
located O
in O
a O
quiet O
, O
green O
countryside O
outside O
the O
city O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
the O
environment O
contributes O
to O
education O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
hectic O
life O
in O
the O
dirty O
city O
center O
, O
they O
can O
prepare O
here O
quietly O
for O
a O
job O

Carlos B-PER
. O

In O

to O
the O

the O

About O
a O

the O
facts O
that O

depress O
him O
at O

But O
most O
of O
the O

finally O
left O

who O

The O

The O

In O

For O

it O

" O

The O
de O
facto O
failure O
of O
Green B-MISC
district I-MISC
member I-MISC
Friedrich B-PER
leads O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
now O
almost O
all O
tasks O
in O
the O
largest O
district O
of O
Hesse B-LOC
would O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
only O
two O

. O

In O
the O
same O
breath O
, O
the O
leader O
of O

opposes O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
Social B-ORG

in O
the O

are O
' O
incapable O
' O
of O

. O

In O
the O
interests O
of O
the O

Krätschmer B-PER
considers O
it O

Background O
: O

On O
Friday O
, O
September O
5 O
, O
1986 O
, O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
breathed O
deeply O
through O
the O
Schloßberghalle B-LOC
Nidderau I-LOC
. O

They O
were O
elected O
to O
the O
leadership O
positions O
in O
the O
Landratsamt O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
Greens B-MISC
. O

The O
main O
officials O
of O
the O
CDU B-ORG
and O
FDP B-ORG
had O
to O
clear O
their O
chairs O
. O

Red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
blooming O
spaces O
of O
that O
time O
have O
now O
been O
torn O
apart O
. O

The O
last O
" O
great O
act O
" O
: O

After O
tough O
rounds O
of O
negotiations O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
was O
able O
to O
pass O
the O
1992/93 O
double O
budget O
last O
year O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
. O

Then O
the O
SPD B-ORG
stumbled O
into O
a O
voting O
disaster O
in O
the O
county O
day O
in O
the O
poll O
. O

Even O
if O
not O
wanted O
, O
the O
NPD B-ORG
became O
fertile O
at O
once O
as O
a O
brown O
sparkle O
on O
the O
scale O
. O

The O
sharper O
line O
taken O
by O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
on O
the O
asylum O
issue O
documents O
that O
there O
is O
no O
longer O
any O
consensus O
between O
the O
SPD B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
the O
circle O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

While O
the O
two O
chief O
officials O
openly O
accuse O
the O
country O
of O
failing O
due O
to O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
Coleman B-LOC
barracks I-LOC
, O
which O
were O
converted O
to O
refugee O
accommodation O
, O
and O
return O
buses O
with O
asylum O
seekers O
( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O
, O
Greens B-ORG
find O
it O
" O
wretched O
and O
reprehensible O
when O
asylum O
debates O
get O
a O
voice O
- O
raising O
character O
" O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
buses O
with O
refugees O
are O
sent O
back O
from O
Main B-LOC
- I-LOC
Kinzig I-LOC
- O
Kreis O
is O
not O
an O
isolated O
case O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1986 O
, O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
, O
then O
still O
leader B-MISC
of O
the O
SPD O
in O
the O
Main O
- O
Kinzig B-ORG
parliament I-ORG
, O
praised O
that O
the O
CDU B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
circle O
had O
refused O
to O
accept O
a O
group O
of O
asylum O
seekers O
. O

In O
a O
current O
hour O
, O
this O
was O
described O
by O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
as O
" O
no O
serious O
action O
" O
. O

The O
asylum O
seekers O
had O
" O
precedented O
themselves O
at O
best O
as O
a O
beach O
property O
, O
" O
the O
current O
Land O
Council O
said O
at O
the O
time O
. O

If O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
Erich B-PER
Pipa I-PER
to O
be O
re O
- O
elected O
to O
the O
First O
District O
Member O
next O
Friday O
in O
that O
same O
Schloßberg B-LOC
Hall I-LOC
, O
it O
needs O
two O
additional O
votes O
from O
another O
camp O
in O
addition O
to O
its O
own O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
had O
already O
allowed O
Pipa B-PER
not O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
secret O
ballot O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
has O
resisted O
speculation O
that O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
Union O
there O
would O
be O
allegedly O
" O
U O
- O
boats O
" O
who O
would O
have O
fought O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
First O
Deputy O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
according O
to O
his O
own O
statements O
, O
" O
in O
no O
way O
wants O
to O
be O
voted O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
neo B-MISC
- I-MISC
Nazis I-MISC
" O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
he O
considers O
it O
necessary O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
First O
Circle O
Member O
does O
not O
remain O
unfilled O
for O
months O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
who O
has O
already O
accused O
journalists O
who O
have O
fallen O
into O
disgrace O
with O
abstractions O
, O
appeals O
to O
district O
lawmakers O
not O
to O
shirk O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

Thus O
he O
has O
already O
publicly O
stated O
that O
" O
another O
circus O
director O
must O
run O
if O
I O
am O
not O
re O

elected O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
" O
. O

The O
position O
would O
then O
have O
to O
be O
advertised O
immediately O
and O
an O
election O
preparatory O
committee O
established O
. O

On O

not O

The O
SPD B-ORG

however O
, O
has O
announced O
that O
the O

motion O
will O
be O
put O
to O
the O

only O
if O
it O
is O

out O
that O
Pipa B-PER
can O
remain O
in O
office O
only O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
NPD B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
district O

, O
however O
, O
not O
only O
the O
topic O
of O
re O
- O
election O
plays O
a O

it O
is O
soon O

about O

. O

Even O
before O
the O
summer O

, O
the O
district O
chairman O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
had O
declared O
that O
the O
SPD B-ORG
had O
to O
use O
Friedrich B-PER
again O
as O
a O
garbage O
collector O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
parliamentary O
term O
Friedrich B-PER
was O
even O
praised O
by O
the O

Green B-MISC

as O

100 O

as O
one O
of O

According O

this O

The O

Morlock B-PER

contradicts O
the O
BUND B-MISC

Rolf B-PER
Neidhardt I-PER
decidedly O
. O

Dioxins O
have O
only O
existed O
in O
the O

since O
the O
beginning O
of O
chlorochemistry O
. O

In O
raw O
oil O

, O
centuries O
- O
old O
Eskimo O
larvae O
, O
no O
traces O
of O
dioxin O
have O
been O
discovered O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
scientific O
investigations O
into O
wood O

would O
only O
have O
revealed O
high O
dioxin O
concentrations O
if O
, O
for O
example O
, O
PVC O
was O
added O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
so O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
the O
federal O
government O
considers O
public O
aid O
necessary O
and O
pleads O
for O
the O
closure O
of O
unnecessary O
sources O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
BUND B-ORG
sees O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
and O
speaks O
out O
against O
the O
incineration O
of O
people O
in O
whose O
fat O
tissue O
dioxin O
concentrates O
ablagere O
. O

Although O
Gerhard B-PER
Morlock I-PER
does O
not O
disagree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxin O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
. O

However O
, O
he O
considers O
the O
installation O
of O
for O
example O
an O
electric O
filter O
in O
the O
plant O
to O
be O
sufficient O
to O
meet O
the O
limit O
value O
. O
" O

I O
think O
the O
bit O
of O
exhaust O
from O
the O
crematorium O
is O
inconceivable O
, O
" O
said O
Morlock B-PER

He O
sees O
the O
" O

at O
the O
Staudinger B-LOC
power O

" O
as O
a O

much O
greater O
source O
of O

. O

In O
his O
opinion O
, O
it O
should O
be O
measured O
there O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
per O
cubic O

of O

will O
probably O
hardly O
be O
measurable O
, O
nevertheless O

" O
explains O
Peter B-PER
Klemm I-PER

" O

There O
are O
many O

" O

For O
him O
, O
the O
danger O
of O
addiction O
is O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
expression O
of O
personality O
, O
and O
it O
is O
precisely O
here O
that O
the O

In O

have O
the O

to O
guide O
their O

The O
children O
must O
learn O
to O
say O
" O
no O
" O

sometimes O

they O
should O
develop O
the O

The O
fact O

After O
months O
of O
consultations O
in O
the O
authorities O
, O
tough O
negotiations O
of O
the O
Magistrate O
with O
Hoechst B-ORG
AG I-ORG
and O
difficult O
voting O
discussions O
between O
SPD B-ORG
and O
Greens B-ORG
, O
the O
Römer B-MISC

has O
now O
presented O
the O
planning O
for O
the O
connection O
of O
the O
Upper B-MISC
Leuna B-LOC
Bridge I-LOC
to O
the O
local O
road O

on O
the O

side I-MISC

Afterwards O
, O
only O
a O
two O

is O
built O
between O
the O

Bridge I-LOC
and O
the O

( O
B B-LOC

) O
, O
which O
passes O
directly O
at O
the O
Hoechst B-ORG
AG I-ORG
plant O
and O
is O
connected O
to O
the O
Bundesstraße O
near O
the O
Kelsterbacher B-LOC
Knoten I-LOC
. O

The O
cost O
is O
estimated O
at O
around O
37.5 O
million O
marks O
. O

While O
the O
bridge O
construction O
itself O
has O
now O
been O
almost O
completed O
, O
it O
is O
currently O
not O
possible O
to O
estimate O
when O
the O
construction O

the O

can O
be O
started O
. O

Even O
if O
the O

would O
already O
agree O
to O
the O
October O
session O
and O
the O
Magistrate O
then O
requests O
the O
Darmstadt O
government O
president O
to O
set O
the O
plan O
, O
the O
next O

are O
pure O
speculation O
. O

Because O
the O
Bund B-ORG
für I-ORG
Umwelt I-ORG

Naturschutz I-ORG
( O
BUND B-ORG
) O
has O
long O
announced O
its O
opposition O
to O
the O
project O
. O

The O
conservationists O
want O
to O
connect O
the O
extended O
Leunastraße B-LOC
only O
with O
the O
existing O
Kelsterbacher B-LOC
Weg I-LOC
and O
from O
there O
to O

In O
the O
opinion O
of O
Gabriele B-PER
Dehmer I-PER
, O
Commissioner O
- O
in O

Chief O
of O
the O
Road B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
, O
however O
, O
this O
connection O
is O
" O
not O
realistic O
" O
. O

The O
Kelsterbach B-LOC
road I-LOC
was O
much O
too O
narrow O
and O
could O
not O
cope O
with O
future O
traffic O
. O

The O
BUND B-ORG
has O
announced O
to O
raise O
an O
objection O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
plan O
- O
setting O

- O
if O
unsuccessful O
- O
to O
appeal O
as O
a O
natural O

association O
to O
the O

. O

These O
procedures O
could O
block O
the O
project O
for O

. O

The O
Magistrate O
's O
proposal O
points O
out O
that O
the O

be O

as O
possible O
. O

It O
should O
only O
have O
one O

in O

direction O
and O
be O
a O
maximum O
of O
seven O
meters O
wide O
. O

The O
planned O
walking O

are O
to O
be O
separated O
from O
the O

by O
a O

In O
the O

In O

the O
underlying O
SPD B-MISC
proposal I-MISC
- O
focused O
on O

whether O

: O

" O
We O

" O

The O
city O
does O
not O

make O
it O
easy O

to O
tell O
the O

exactly O
what O
it O
comes O
to O
: O

The O
sealing O
of O
drinking O
water O
lines O
against O
the O
drinking O
water O
system O
. O

So O
if O
the O
toilet O

is O
operated O
with O
indigenous O
water O
and O
in O
the O
case O
that O
the O
rainwater O

empty O
, O
also O
a O

it O
must O

It O

how O

Biwer B-PER
said O

As O
the O

describes O

he O
has O
conducted O
many O
conversations O
with O

on O
the O
subject O
of O
water O
and O
water O
saving O
in O
recent O
weeks O
: O

" O
I O
have O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
understanding O
for O
the O
savings O
. O
" O

Some O
would O
have O
said O
that O
you O
had O
to O
think O
about O
it O
much O
earlier O
. O

Especially O
some O
older O
Rosbachers B-MISC
had O
been O
of O
this O
opinion O
, O
Medebach B-PER
reported O
. O

The O
Magistrate O
of O
Niddatal B-LOC
has O
translated O
the O
regulation O
on O
establishing O
the O
water O
emergency O
for O
citizens O
into O
comprehensible O
information O
and O
published O
in O
the O
local O
notice O
paper O
. O
" O

The O
Niddataler B-MISC
now O
know O
what O
is O
allowed O
and O
what O
is O
not O
, O
" O
Mayor O
Wilfried B-PER
Martin I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
admitted O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
rainwater O
collection O
systems O
, O
the O
city O
grants O
exemption O
from O
the O
" O
connection O
and O
use O
obligation O
" O
. O

This O
means O
an O
indirect O
subsidy O
, O
explains O
the O
mayor O
, O
because O
those O
affected O
will O
then O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
canal O
fees O
for O
drinking O
water O
. O

That O
's O
4.50 O
marks O
per O
cubic O
meter O
anyway O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Martin B-PER
is O
not O
so O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
Emergency O
Regulation O
. O

As O
reported O
lawn O
areas O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
be O
demolished O
, O
he O
fears O
great O
damage O
to O
the O
sports O
facilities O
. O

He O
has O
therefore O
applied O
to O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Government O
for O
an O
exemption O
. O

The O
sports O
facilities O
are O
now O
so O
designed O
that O
they O
can O
also O
be O
played O
after O
rainfall O
, O
and O
well O
drained O
. O

So O
they O
dry O
out O
very O
quickly O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
rained O
regularly O
, O
gives O
Martin B-PER
to O
think O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
the O
sports O
facilities O
were O
not O
sprayed O
, O
damages O
for O
the O
municipality O
of O
around O
50 O
000 O
marks O
per O
place O
would O
have O
to O
be O
paid O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
rain O
has O
come O
to O
the O
help O
of O
the O
oppressed O
municipalities O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
drying O
problem O
is O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
a O
fundamental O
debate O
on O
the O
establishment O
of O
sports O
grounds O
. O

Landrat O
Rolf B-PER
Gnadl I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
has O
already O
opened O
the O
discussion O
on O
golf O
courses O
. O

For O
Niddatal B-LOC
, O
the O
mayor O
does O
not O
see O
the O
water O
problem O
as O
dramatic O
as O
in O
the O
urban O
area O
. O

Increased O
environmental O
awareness O
and O
higher O
canal O
fees O
would O
have O
already O
fluctuated O
the O
water O
consumption O
of O
citizens O

In O

territories O

they O
call O

the O

- O
live O
almost O
two O
million O

clearly O
do O
not O

What O
kind O
of O
political O
perspective O
do O
you O
have O
to O
offer O
these O
people O

Steiner B-PER
: O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
to O
us O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
will O
not O
accept O
anything O
other O
than O
full O
political O
autonomy O

which O
ultimately O
leads O

a O
Palestinian B-LOC

here O
that O
the O

that O

the O

Occasionally O

can O

it O

Because O

the O

behave O

Otherwise O
it O
could O
already O
happen O
that O
someone O
in O
the O
town O

would O
also O
place O
the O

. O

Because O
he O
himself O
has O
received O
some O
samples O
of O
requests O
of O
this O
calibre O
, O
he O
could O

His O
principle O
of O

points O
out O

the O

both O

the O

In O
the O
compilation O

the O
Benedictines B-MISC
were O
often O
given O
professional O
, O
medical O
support O
and O
donations O
in O
the O
form O
of O
medicines O
, O
because O
the O
Tanzanian B-LOC

is O
also O
well O
known O
to O
German B-MISC

. O

For O
the O
exhibition O
, O
which O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
Hanau B-LOC
City I-LOC
Hospital I-LOC
last O
week O
, O
Verdonk B-PER
has O
brought O
only O
a O
part O
of O
the O
exhibition O
pieces O
: O

" O
If O
I O
take O
ghost O
figures O
to O
the O
exhibition O
, O
I O
select O
beforehand O
, O
so O
that O
the O
buyer O
gets O
only O
the O
best O
" O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
always O
so O
, O
" O
that O
every O
face O
is O
carved O
equally O
beautifully O
, O
" O
the O
artists O
would O
n't O
always O
have O
professional O
tools O
available O
to O
cut O
perfect O
works O
. O

But O
perhaps O
it O
is O
also O
what O
makes O
the O
art O
of O
the O
make B-MISC
- I-MISC
up I-MISC
. O

Most O
of O
the O
sculptures O
are O
made O
by O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
in O
a O
state O
of O
fear O
. O

Fear O
is O
the O
constant O
companion O
of O
this O
people O
, O
who O
, O
according O
to O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
, O
live O
in O
an O
unimaginable O
, O
completely O
different O
world O
for O
Europeans B-MISC
. O

For O
her O
was O
a O
dream O
reality O
, O
which O
is O
represented O
in O
her O
works O
: O

" O
If O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
dreams O
that O
their O
ancestors O
are O
evil O
on O
them O
, O
because O
no O
one O
thinks O
of O
them O
anymore O
, O
they O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
start O
to O
cut O
the O
contours O
of O
the O
Grandmother O
" O
. O

Their O
bad O
conscience O
was O
so O
often O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
the O
work O
. O

The O
Makonde B-MISC
also O
constantly O
feel O
surrounded O
by O
demons O
, O
in O
the O
Swahili B-MISC
language I-MISC
" O
Shetani O
" O
. O

Of O
the O
" O
Shetani O
" O
there O
is O
a O
rich O
variety O
. O

They O
are O
mostly O
mixtures O
of O
humans O
and O
animals O
, O
who O
are O
hungry O
, O
drive O
sheep O
's O
neck O
and O
hide O
. O

But O
not O
all O
ghosts O
consider O
the O
maggot B-MISC
to O
be O
dangerous O
: O

" O
The O
good O
spirits O
are O
recognised O
by O
the O
gentle O
and O
large O
eye O
, O
" O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
knows O
. O

The O
sculptors O
also O
deal O
with O
eroticism O
. O

This O
element O
is O
often O
hidden O
under O
symbols O
, O
but O
sometimes O
also O
clearly O
visible O
. O

Sexuality O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
world O
of O
religion O
and O
magic O
, O
a O
uniting O
force O
and O
means O
of O
integration O
. O

The O
fertility O
of O
the O
woman O
stands O
for O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
synonymous O
with O
life O
, O
as O
the O
power O
given O
by O
the O
Creator O
. O

This O
gives O
sexuality O
a O
sacred O
character O
, O
with O
sexual O
organs O
almost O
always O
being O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
. O

Another O
motif O
of O
great O
importance O
is O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
, O
which O
is O
to O
represent O
" O
the O
interconnectedness O
of O
all O
mankind O
" O
. O

They O
do O
not O
live O
as O
we O
do O
in O
Europe B-LOC
as O
an O
individual O
, O
they O
live O
as O
a O
unit O
, O
which O
they O
want O
to O
represent O
artisticly O
in O
the O
tree O
of O
life O
, O
" O
explains O
Verdonk B-PER
the O
mentality O
of O
the O
natural O
people O
. O

That O
is O
why O
he O
could O
never O
answer O
the O
question O
of O
exhibition O
visitors O
, O
as O
the O
respective O
artist O
was O
called O
. O
" O

Since O
no O
one O
signs O
his O
work O
, O
as O
with O
us O
, O
where O
the O
name O
is O
often O
more O
important O
than O
the O
actual O
work O
of O
art O
" O
. O

The O
exhibits O
shown O
in O
Hanau B-LOC
convey O
something O
awkward O
, O
they O
express O
what O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
may O
have O
felt O
during O
the O
production O
. O

The O
magical O
world O
from O
which O
they O
come O
, O
is O
omnipresent O
, O
even O
capable O
of O
infusing O
the O
observers O

fear O
. O

The O
exhibition O
is O
still O
to O
be O
visited O
until O

this O

difficult O

Especially O
for O
the O
heavy O

of O

In O
a O
quarter O
, O
the O

collectors O
had O
put O
up O
seven O
times O
the O
filled O
garbage O
can O
of O
the O

When O
he O
complained O
, O
he O
was O
offered O
additional O
garbage O

, O
even O
free O
of O

. O

That O
he O
accepted O
thanksgiving O

To O
bring O
his O
garbage O
about O
170 O
meters O
far O
to O
a O
place O
where O
the O
tons O
could O
have O
been O
leaking O
, O
he O
refused O
. O

Finally O
stands O
in O
the O
waste O
sink O
that O
the O
garbage O
will O
be O
picked O
up O
at O
the O
property O
. O

Therefore O
, O
he O
demanded O
a O
corresponding O
reduction O
in O
fees O
, O
but O
also O
the O
judges O
granted O
him O
a O
deduction O
. O

They O
relied O
( O
like O
the O
commune O
) O
on O
a O
different O
passport O
of O
the O
statute O
. O

This O
means O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
claim O
to O
normal O
waste O
disposal O
in O
the O
case O
of O
" O
higher O
violence O

And O
bad O
weather O
is O
more O
violence O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
statute O
and O
the O
fee O
notice O
were O
legally O
granted O
, O
and O
the O
claim O
for O
a O
refund O
of O
fees O
was O
therefore O
declared O
unjustified O
. O

Who O
else O
does O
not O
use O
the O
possibility O

leave O
his O
garbage O

empty O

so O
the O
final O
, O
simple O
determination O
of O
the O

, O
could O
later O
also O
not O
claim O

It O
is O
to O
be O

that O

It O

how O

If O

it O

entertainment O

it O

But O
that O
was O

always O
the O
case O

Until O

, O
the O

only O
half O

For O
Heinz B-PER
Schlosser I-PER
, O
the O
once O
patriarchal O
painting O
has O
historical O
reasons O
. O

The O
years O
after O
the O
First B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
were O
troubled O
and O
turbulent O
, O
causing O
many O
young O
people O
distress O
and O
desperation O
. O

They O
were O
longing O
for O
a O

And O
Kaplan O

give O
Georg B-PER
Pistor I-PER
: O

On O
August O
14 O
, O
1922 O
, O
he O
launched O
the O
Catholic O
Fellowship O
. O

The O
objectives O
: O

Training O
and O
sport O
, O
active O
charity O
and O
community O
. O

There O
has O
been O
little O
change O
in O
these O
tasks O
during O
the O
seven O
decades O
of O
existence O
, O
even O
though O
the O
association O
has O
only O
been O
a O
real O

since O
the O
mid-1960s O
. O
” O

Our O
focus O
is O
on O
education O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
and O
refers O
to O
a O
rich O
range O
of O
lectures O
and O
seminars O
. O

And O
there O
is O
little O
that O
can O
be O
prescribed O
by O
the O
Highlanders B-MISC
. O
" O

Topics O
that O
concern O
Rome B-LOC
that O
are O
not O
up O
to O
date O
with O
us O
. O
" O

The O
members O
do O
what O
seems O
important O
to O
them O
. O
” O

However O
, O
we O
demand O
social O
policy O
commitment O
from O
all O
. O
" O

And O
that O
of O
course O
also O
means O
, O
to O
deal O
with O
critical O
and O
current O
questions O
- O
for O
example O
paragraph O
218 O
. O
May O
the O
church O
leaders O
there O
also O
dogmatically O
stur O
help O
for O
fellowmen O
: O

not O
only O
be O
far O
from O
home O
, O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
goes O
open O
to O
: O

" O
All O
opinions O
are O
represented O
here O
, O
" O
Schlosser B-PER
says O
. O

Talked O
about O
everything O
. O
" O

We O
work O
freely O
, O
are O
not O
under O
pressure O
either O
from O
the O
parish O
communities O
or O
from O
other O
places O
. O
" O

Can O
Schlosser B-PER
imagine O
a O
discussion O
with O
the O
church O
critic O
Eugen B-PER
Drewermann I-PER
? O
" O

Why O
not O
? O
" O

The O
interest O
, O
especially O
among O
young O
people O
, O
would O
certainly O
be O
there O
. O

But O
whether O
Drewermann B-PER
would O
come O
to O
a O
place O
like O
Hochheim B-LOC
, O
Schlosser B-PER
asks O
. O

The O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
has O
also O
critically O
highlighted O
another O
topic O
: O

500 O
years O
after O
Columbus B-PER
. O

The O
anniversary O
was O
for O
the O
members O
little O
reason O
to O
celebrate O
, O
rather O
an O
occasion O
to O
reflect O
. O

Finally O
, O
they O
help O
in O
many O
countries O
to O
mitigate O
the O
consequences O
of O
exploitation O
: O

for O
example O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
project O
is O
to O
stop O
people O
from O
fleeing O
the O
countryside O
, O
or O
in O
Nigeria B-LOC
when O
building O
a O
well O
and O
a O
vocational O
training O
centre O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
far O
from O
home O
that O
something O
must O
be O
done O
for O
the O
fellow O
human O
beings O
. O

Especially O
the O
migrants O
need O
support O
to O
integrate O
into O
society O
. O

Tips O
on O
the O
protection O
of O
tenants O
, O
on O
social O
law O
and O
other O
everyday O
issues O
are O
necessary O
. O

Schlosser B-PER
's I-PER
example O
: O

" O
The O
insurance O
representatives O
go O
to O
the O
people O
's O
doors O
; O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
signing O
. O
" O

So O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
also O
tries O
in O
consumer O
counselling O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
commitment O
costs O
not O
only O
time O
, O
but O
also O
money O
. O
" O

We O
just O
have O
to O
do O
something O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
calling O
the O
financial O
source O
the O
social O
part O
of O
family O
life O
: O

Seven O
events O
to O
Fasching O
and O
the O
stand O
at O
the O
wine O
festival O
must O
throw O
enough O
to O
get O
through O
the O
rounds O
. O

And O
of O
course O
donations O
are O
collected O
again O
and O
again O
- O
also O
at O
the O
birthday O
celebration O
for O
the O
70th O
anniversary O
on O
Sunday O
, O
August O
30th O
, O
10.30 O
am O
, O
in O
the O
Church O
of O
Peter B-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
. O

The O
money O
should O
go O
to O
Peter B-PER
Osuchukwu I-PER
. O

The O
priest O
from O
Nigeria B-LOC
wants O
to O
finance O
projects O
in O
his O
home O
community O
. O

But O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
seems O
to O
make O
little O
impression O
on O
young O
people O
. O
" O

We O
're O
going O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
referring O
to O
declining O
numbers O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
for O
young O
people O
on O
offer O
- O
the O
regular O
meetings O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
educational O
holiday O
, O
whose O
goal O
the O
group O
chooses O
itself O
. O
" O

Well O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
" O
for O
the O
future O
, O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
young O
people O
will O
participate O
more O
. O

Because O
only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
they O
shape O
society O
, O
through O
engagement O
in O
associations O
, O
parties O
or O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
