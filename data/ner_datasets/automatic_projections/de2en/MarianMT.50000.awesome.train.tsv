Discussions O
on O
asylum O
seekers O
, O
resettlement O
and O
immigration O
issues O
have O
dominated O
politics O
and O
the O
media O
in O
Germany B-LOC
in O
recent O
months O
. O

It O
is O
therefore O
not O
difficult O
at O
the O
moment O
to O
attract O
attention O
with O
the O
publication O
of O
a O
book O
on O
refugees O
and O
displaced O
persons O
in O
West B-LOC
Germany I-LOC
from O
1945 O
to O
1990 O
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
there O
are O
hardly O
any O
serious O
scientific O
discussions O
that O
have O
taken O
up O
this O
issue O
so O
far O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
such O
a O
topicality O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
a O
doubtless O
forthcoming O
debate O
to O
deprive O
its O
core O
in O

of O

Albrecht B-PER
Lehmann I-PER
, O
in O
his O
book B-MISC
I I-MISC
m O
Freußer O
unintentionally O
at O
home O
, O
tries O
to O
adopt O
a O
neutral O
perspective O
, O
free O
of O
blame O
and O
innocency O
, O
against O
a O
policy O
and O
its O
consequences O
, O
which O
led O
to O
twelve O
million O
people O
fleeing O
or O
displaced O
from O
East O
Germany O
and O
the O
German O
settlement O
areas O
in O
Eastern O
Europe O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
. O

In O
what O
way O
the O
" O
refugees O
" O
- O
as O
it O
was O
called O
immediately O
after O
the O
war O
with O
a O
pejorative O
bytaste O
- O
or O
" O
displaced O
" O
- O
so O
the O
common O
name O
since O
c. O

1948 O
- O
found O
in O
their O
new O
circumstances O
and O
how O
these O
experiences O
have O
traded O
over O
the O
next O
decades O
in O
the O
different O
generations O
to O
today O
, O
Lehmann B-PER
demonstrates O
by O
means O
of O
a O
series O
of O
narratives O
, O
personal O
records O
, O
diaries O
and O
documents O
of O
the O
displaced O
press O
. O

Today O
, O
a O
picture O
is O
promoted O
, O
which O
is O
not O
surprising O
, O
but O
in O
its O
compilation O
convincingly O
allows O
readers O
to O
carry O
out O
a O
specific O
kind O
of O
foreignness O
experience O
. O

The O
respective O
experiences O
and O
their O
coping O
are O
presented O
very O
differently O
. O

However O
, O
certain O
topics O
appear O
again O
and O
again O
: O

Thus O
, O
the O
rape O
of O
German B-MISC
women O
by O
members O
of O
the O
Red B-ORG
Army I-ORG
not O
only O
led O
to O
irreparable O
mental O
disorders O
among O
women O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
complicated O
marriage O
relationships O
that O
dominated O
the O
lives O
of O
whole O
families O
often O
for O
years O
after O
these O
events O
. O

The O
uprooting O
from O
the O
old O
homeland O
produced O
in O
quite O
a O
few O
cases O
forms O
of O
social O
over O
- O
adjustment O
, O
which O
caused O
difficulties O
with O
the O
old O
- O
established O
population O
, O
especially O
in O
narrow O
village O
communities O
. O

A O
" O
sentimental O
perseverance O
" O
on O
old O
traditions O
and O
customs O
expressed O
how O
incapable O
the O
displaced O
were O
to O
forget O
the O
old O

In O
all O
narratives O
it O
is O
obvious O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
social O
harmony O
has O
been O
a O
guiding O
factor O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
creation O
of O
a O
new O
sense O
of O
community O
should O
compensate O
for O
the O
loss O
experienced O
in O
most O
cases O
as O
a O
cruel O

In O
addition O
to O
showing O
such O
typical O
difficulties O
, O
a O
strength O
of O
the O
book O
is O
to O
highlight O
the O
differences O
in O
the O
experiences O
of O
different O
generations O
. O

Thus O
it O
is O
plausible O
that O
the O
generation O
that O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
sixties O
and O
seventies O
wanted O
little O
to O
do O
with O
the O
past O
of O
their O
parents O
who O
had O
been O
expelled O
. O

A O
consciousness O
about O
the O
" O
lost O
home O
" O
existed O
; O
however O
, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
sentimentally O
occupied O
. O

This O
changed O
only O
in O
the O
1980s O
, O
when O
in O
Germany B-LOC
a O
renaissance O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
homeland O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
reference O
to O
the O
former O
German B-MISC
settlement O
areas O
again O
. O

Lehmann B-PER
is O
not O
tired O
in O
the O
description O
and O
reproduction O
of O
the O
stories O
of O
displaced O
persons O
, O
repeatedly O
pointing O
out O
that O
, O
despite O
long O
- O
tamed O
prejudices O
, O
they O
do O
not O
attach O
any O
revanchism O
. O

One O
may O
believe O
the O
author O
, O
who O
understands O
his O
book O
as O
a O
contribution O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
different O
nations O
, O
when O
he O
calls O
in O
this O
sense O
to O
understand O
the O
old O
homeland O
only O
as O
a O
" O
home O
in O
the O
head O
" O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
this O
certainly O
laudable O
attitude O
and O
programmatics O
, O
the O
many O
reports O
and O
narratives O
leave O
a O
pale O
aftertaste O
, O
which O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
methodology O
of O
German B-MISC
ethnology O
. O

History O
, O
as O
it O
is O
written O
in O
this O
book O
, O
is O
primarily O
reproduced O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
it O
. O

The O
one O
story O
decays O
into O
many O
narratives O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
can O
be O
classified O
scientifically O
according O
to O
different O
genres O
. O

So O
success O
stories O
, O
swans O
and O
trump O
stories O
are O
typical O
forms O
of O
narrating O
a O
particular O
group O
, O
which O
today O
still O
want O
to O
forget O
their O
initial O
difficulties O
in O
the O
new O
home O
. O

A O
ousting O
form O
of O
narration O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
to O
be O
found O
among O
women O
who O
have O
become O
victims O
of O
rape O
. O

However O
, O
this O
scientifically O
derived O
classification O
of O
narrative O
types O
remains O
only O
external O
. O

The O
narratives O
themselves O
are O
central O
in O
the O
form O
of O
presentation O
available O
here O
; O
a O
reflection O
on O
them O
and O
thus O
a O
possibility O
of O
evaluation O
and O
classification O
remains O

This O
, O
however O
, O
makes O
it O
all O
too O
easy O
for O
compassionate O
understanding O
or O
sympathetic O
identification O
with O
those O
affected O
to O
forget O
those O
constellations O
of O
history O
, O
in O
the O
context O
of O
which O
the O
unquestionably O
cruel O
individual O
events O
should O
necessarily O
be O
presented O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
seems O
quite O
irritating O
when O
the O
" O
double O
luck O
" O
of O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
from O
Transylvania B-LOC
is O
reported O
, O
who O
as O
a O
people B-MISC
German I-MISC
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
join O
the O
Wehrmacht B-ORG
, O
but O
had O
to O
become O
the O
Waffen B-ORG
- I-ORG
SS I-ORG
; O
which O
could O
thus O
save O
itself O
over O
the O
war O
years O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
was O
spared O
from O
the O
prisoner O
of O
war O
. O

To O
imagine O
the O
happiness O
of O
an O
Anton B-PER
K. I-PER
is O
one O
side O
. O

The O
other O
must O
be O
to O
place O
the O
individual O
fates O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
Second B-MISC
World I-MISC
War I-MISC
and O
the O
years O
thereafter O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
an O
objective O
perspective O
can O
be O
taken O

It O
is O
a O
mistake O
to O
assume O
that O
the O
mere O
reproduction O
of O
authentic O
reports O
must O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
an O
appropriate O
view O
of O
history O
. O

Rather O
, O
it O
risks O
looking O
at O
history O
, O
which O
stylizes O
all O
those O
involved O
to O
their O
victims O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
that O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
also O
deal O
with O
the O
victims O
of O
history O
who O
were O
on O
the O
perpetrator O
's O
side O
. O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
avoided O
in O
doing O
so O
, O
to O
promote O
a O
relativisation O
of O
history O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
blur O
all O
differences O
in O
favour O
of O
an O
" O
understood O
understanding O
" O
. O

In O
this O
context O
it O
is O
not O
enough O
to O
spend O
programmatic O
slogans O
on O
" O
Reconciliation O
of O
all O
cultures O
" O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
other O
fundamental O
misunderstandings O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
blurring O
of O
crucial O
differences O
. O

In O
Lehmann B-PER
's O
case O
, O
this O
blurry O
is O
most O
evident O
where O
he O
advocates O
a O
" O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
" O
and O
declares O
this O
to O
be O
a O
perspective O
that O
should O
emerge O
from O
a O
non O
- O
revanchist O
resettlement O
perspective O
, O
so O
that O
the O
German B-MISC
solution O
to O
the O
resettlement O
problem O
becomes O
a O
model O
for O
those O
questions O
and O
problems O
arising O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
immigration O
movements O
: O

" O
The O
theme O
of O
this O
book O
remains O
current O
: O

The O
question O
of O
how O
individuals O
and O
families O
with O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
find O
a O
new O
home O
in O
our O
country O
, O
in O
which O
images O
of O
memory O
they O
carry O
and O
trade O
the O
old O
home O
and O
the O
culture O
of O
the O
region O
of O
origin O
, O
in O
which O
way O
they O
maintain O
contact O
with O
the O
first O
home O
. O
" O

In O
the O
equation O
of O
the O
problems O
of O
resettlement O
and O
asylum O
seekers O
as O
well O
as O
their O
respective O
experiences O
of O
foreignness O
, O
the O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
these O
groups O
is O
swept O
under O
the O
table O
. O

A O
post O
- O
national O
Europe B-LOC
consists O
in O
the O
cohabitation O
of O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
ethnic O
groups O
, O
which O
it O
has O
forcibly O
or O
deliberately O
led O
to O
Germany B-LOC
or O
other O
European B-LOC
countries O
. O

However O
, O
these O
groups O
' O
experiences O
of O
alienity O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
fundamentally O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
resettlements O
of O
the O
forties O
or O
those O
of O
their O
children O
decades O

The O
latter O
have O
been O
proven O
to O
have O
identified O
with O
Germany B-LOC
despite O
the O
losses O
of O
the O
" O
old O
homeland O
in O
the O
East O
" O
, O
have O
built O
up O
a O
national O
consciousness O
due O
to O
their O
ethnicity O
. O

Such O
identification O
is O
neither O
possible O
nor O
desirable O
for O
immigrants O
. O

While O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
homogeneous O
nation O
state O
was O
decisive O
for O
the O
resettlement O
, O
it O
is O
today O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
heterogeneous O
nation O
state O
for O
asylum O
seekers O
and O
immigrants O
. O

A O
focus O
on O
subjective O
sensitivities O
, O
as O
set O
out O
in O
this O
volume O
, O
should O
not O
lead O
to O
neglecting O
fundamental O
, O
objective O
differences O
. O

This O
does O
not O
serve O

An O

Andrea B-PER
recognized O
herself O

At O
that O
moment O

was O
aware O
that O
she O
had O
to O

something O

Andrea B-PER
took O
the O
initiative O
and O
registered O
in O
a O
clinic O
for O

in O
the O
Allgäu B-LOC

A O
few O
weeks O

, O
she O
left O
her O
husband O
and O

for O
three O
months O
of O
therapy O
. O

The O
relatives O
accused O
her O
of O
being O
a O
raven O

mother O

For O
Andrea B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
was O
clear O
: O

" O
I O
can O
only O
be O
a O
good O

I O

Sociology O
is O
not O
without O
reason O
the O
suspicion O
of O
high O
stacking O
. O

For O
it O
claims O
nothing O
less O
than O
its O
specific O
subject O
- O
matter O
than O
the O
whole O
of O
society O

What O
is O
surprising O
is O
that O
the O
society O
so O
targeted O
reacted O
suspiciously O
to O
the O
acquisition O
by O

. O

Until O

by O

was O
only O
in O

that O
she O

The O
Society B-ORG
of I-ORG
Sociology I-ORG
fell O
blushingly O
into O
the O
arms O
. O

This O
yes O
word O
has O
led O
to O
a O
covenant O
for O
life O
, O
but O
it O
has O
become O
anything O
but O
a O
fervent O
love O
relationship O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
enthusiasm O
behind O
the O
expectations O
of O
this O
young O
social O
science O
was O
at O
the O
height O
of O
its O
academic O
expansion O
. O

The O
conviction O
, O
which O
was O
combined O
with O
that O
demanding O
objective O
of O
knowledge O
, O
diminished O
to O
formulate O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
whole O
society O
, O
which O
should O
at O
the O
same O
time O
be O
critical O
and O
practically O
changing O
. O

Are O
we O
therefore O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
process O
in O
which O
the O
utopian O
energies O
, O
which O
were O
invested O
in O
the O
enormous O
enterprise O
of O
a O
revolution O
of O
all O
outdated O

and O
living O
conditions O
to O
be O
brought O
about O
by O

and O

, O

In O
other O
words O
: O

How O
can O
the O
attractiveness O
of O
sociology O
be O
regained O
as O
a O
reality O
- O
changing O
force O
which O
it O
lost O
in O
the O
course O
of O
its O
" O

to O
normal O
science O
? O

There O
are O
three O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
utopia O
in O
sociology O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
the O
utopia O
itself O
, O
which O
has O
become O
modest O
from O
the O
historical O
experiences O
of O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
great O
visionary O
promises O
, O
which O
have O
emerged O
from O
the O
historical O
upsurge O
of O
recent O
times O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
increasingly O
concrete O
utopian O
challenge O
has O
arisen O
through O
the O
simple O
cunning O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
utopian O
ideals O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
historical O
situation O
has O
assumed O
a O
gravity O
that O
allows O
any O
longing O
projection O
of O
a O
completely O
different O
in O
the O
morning O
only O
as O
an O
apocalypse O
. O

In O
the O
critical O
tradition O
of O
social O
theory O
, O
the O
ideals O
at O
the O
origin O
of O
modernity O
were O
transformed O
into O
the O
concrete O
utopia O
of O
the O
real O
history O
of O
progressive O
bourgeois O
emancipation O
. O

The O
ladder O
goes O
from O
the O
fictitious O
future O
paintings O
of O
a O
Morus B-PER
, O
Campanella B-PER
and O
Bacon B-PER
to O
the O
technical O
and O
early O
socialist O
utopianism O
of O
an O
Owen B-PER
, O
Saint B-PER
- I-PER
Simon I-PER
, O
Fourier B-PER
and O
Proudhon B-PER
. O

Against O
these O
utopian O
socialists O
Marx B-PER
polemized O
with O
all O
the O
sharpness O
that O
accused O
them O
of O
being O
mere O
dreamers O
. O

He O
himself O
puts O
like O
so O
much O
, O
so O
also O
the O
utopia O
from O
the O
head O
on O
the O
feet O
and O
comes O
materialistic O
to O
the O
point O
: O

In O
communism O
, O
utopia O
and O
reality O
merge O
as O
the O
society O
of O
free O
producers O
, O
as O
material O
abundance O
and O
as O
transparent O
social O
relations O
for O
all O
members O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
this O
concretization O
of O
utopia O
has O
not O
led O
anyone O
to O
Paradise O
, O
which O
was O
promised O
. O

For O

as O
we O

hope O
for O

is O
by O
no O

new O
. O

In O
order O
to O
avoid O
the O
foreseeable O
catastrophe O
, O
already O
leading O
sociologists O
of O
the O
Weimar B-MISC
era I-MISC
such O
as O
Max B-PER
Weber I-PER

Karl B-PER
Mannheim I-PER
argued O
that O
the O
real O

And O
in O
fact O

Rule O

, O
democratic O
self O

determination O
and O
material O

are O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
unenchanted O
form O
of O
the O
realization O
of O
the O
utopia O
that O
has O
long O
been O
brought O
to O

: O

Everyone O
produces O
according O

This O

of O

however O

overtaken O

by O

the O

is O
not O
much O
more O
than O
a O
residual O

the O
unstoppable O
disaster O
as O
a O
result O
of O

generalisation O
of O
the O

" O

for O

" O
by O
pause O
and O

. O

Is O
this O
utopia O
not O
a O
threat O
to O
the O
banishment O
of O
the O
omnipotence O
of O
the O
present O
? O

As O
the O
critical O
force O
of O
utopian O
thought O
fades O
in O
Enlightenment O
Science O
, O
the O
dimension O
of O
historical O
meaning O
formation O
in O
the O
horizon O
of O
historical O
target O
perspectives O
disappears O
in O
social O
self O
- O
thematization O
. O

This O
vacuum O
is O
not O
only O
a O
breeding O
ground O
for O
ideologies O
such O
as O
that O
of O
posthistoire O
, O
but O
this O
utopianism O
also O
promotes O
the O
fixation O
of O
replacement O
programs O
such O
as O
fundamentalism O
, O
regionalism O
and O
feminism O
. O

It O
lacks O
the O
memory O
of O
what O
is O
unrequited O
in O
utopian O
thinking O
, O
it O
is O
dispensed O
with O
that O
utopian O
forward O
thinking O
that O
strikes O
the O
spark O
that O
can O
ignite O
the O
light O
with O
which O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
better O
society O
goes O
along O
. O

A O
disciplinaryly O
organised O
science O
business O
is O
objectively O
overburdened O
against O
the O
risks O
of O
the O
risk O
society O
. O

For O
the O
growing O
destructive O
potentials O
in O
nature O
and O
society O
generated O
by O
the O
individual O
sciences O
themselves O
have O
their O
reason O
, O
not O
least O
because O
the O
subjects O
only O
operate O
navel O
shows O
and O
remain O
in O
their O
ivory O
towers O
. O

In O
this O
imperative O
multidisciplinary O
cooperation O
of O
the O
natural O
, O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
, O
the O
science O
grows O
a O
special O
responsibility O
from O
society O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
its O
object O
relation O
to O
the O
totality O
of O
the O
social O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
sociology O
has O
the O
self O
- O
critical O
task O
of O
returning O
to O
its O
own O
home O
and O
acting O
contagious O
by O
this O
exemplary O
nature O
. O

Only O
as O
a O
" O
house O
of O
open O
doors O
" O
with O
internal O
plurality O
enables O
a O
process O
of O
combining O
diverse O
methods O
and O
theories O
. O

The O
cognitive O
identity O
of O
sociology O
is O
by O
no O
means O
endangered O
by O
this O
openness O
, O
since O
the O
subject O
has O
stabilised O
itself O
organizationally O
and O
seems O
to O
secure O
its O
academic O
reputation O
. O

Their O
status O
of O
interpretational O
science O
requires O
the O
practice O
of O
extreme O
tolerance O
to O
the O
competing O
paradigms O
, O
different O
methodological O
approaches O
and O
the O
divergent O
interpretation O
of O
social O
issues O
. O

Because O
social O
analyses O
can O
not O
operate O
with O
an O
objectiveistic O
claim O
to O
knowledge O
. O

Rather O
, O
social O
theory O
convinces O
through O
the O
formation O
of O
arguments O
, O
i.e. O
through O
empirical O
prudence O
and O
interpretative O
plausibility O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
future O
of O
sociology O
lies O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
unity O
of O
traditions O
that O
originally O
diverge O
: O

the O
experiential O
method O
of O
cognition O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
the O
hermeneutics O
of O
the O
humanities O
on O
the O

This O
principle O
of O
tolerance O
in O
one O
's O
own O
house O
also O
implies O
a O
direct O
connection O
to O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
same O
street O
, O
i.e. O
the O
strict O
cooperation O
of O
sociology O
with O
other O
social O
sciences O
, O
if O
it O
does O
not O
want O
to O
reveal O
its O
great O
objective O
of O
knowledge O
, O
which O
according O
to O
Horkheimer O
consists O
in O
formulating O
a O
theory O
of O
the O
historical O
course O
of O
the O
epoch O
. O

This O
gigantic O
research O
program O
can O
only O
be O
realized O
if O
sociology O
becomes O
the O
vehicle O
of O
communication O
between O
the O
subjects O
of O
history O
, O
economics O
, O
anthropology O
, O
ethnology O
and O
psychology O
, O
among O
others O
, O
which O
are O
jointly O
engaged O
in O
a O
philosophical O
fundamental O
reflection O
, O
are O
ready O
for O
a O
continuous O
exchange O
of O

scientific O
knowledge O
progress O
and O
systematically O
link O
the O
empirical O
research O
efforts O
with O
the O
formation O
of O
theory O
. O

This O
orientation O
of O
the O
social O
sciences O
towards O
a O
historical O
and O
empirically O
substantial O
theory O
of O
the O
social O
one O
to O
be O
developed O
through O
research O
cooperation O
is O
only O
a O
first O
step O
. O

A O
second O
one O
must O
follow O

For O
the O
increasingly O
specialized O
social O
sciences O
rinsing O
the O
object O
of O
their O
research O
efforts O
not O
only O
between O
the O
fingers O
, O
but O
the O
meaning O
of O
their O
teaching O
and O
research O
is O
limited O
to O
the O
work O
of O
the O
shoemaker O
who O
remains O
with O
his O
groin O
, O
the O
water O
may O
also O
stand O
to O
his O

. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
future O
perspective O
of O
the O
humanities O
and O
social O
sciences O
lies O
in O
the O
emerging O
coalition O
of O
human O
sciences O
. O

According O
to O
the O
American B-MISC
historian O
Robert B-PER
Darnton I-PER
, O
a O
new O
configuration O
of O
subjects O
, O
which O
consequently O
involves O
the O
dissolution O
of O
traditional O
faculties O
and O
departments O
, O
leads O
to O
a O
boost O
of O
innovation O
: O

The O
one O
- O
dimensionality O
of O
cause O
and O
event O
research O
is O
overcome O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
reality O
- O
scientific O
understanding O
of O
the O
symbolic O
cultural O
system O
as O
the O
common O
point O
of O
reference O
of O
the O
human O
sciences O

Let O
's O
sum O
up O
: O

sociology O
must O
first O
recognise O
the O
status O
of O
an O
empirical O
, O
understanding O
and O
critical O
social O
science O
not O
only O
for O
itself O
, O
but O
also O
productively O
exploit O
its O
character O
as O
a O
multi O
- O
paradigm O
science O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
project O
requires O
a O
restructured O
social O
theory O
of O
interdisciplinary O
cooperation O
among O
the O
various O
subjects O
of O
social O
science O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
its O
perspective O
on O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
human O
life O
context O
, O
science O
from O
society O
is O
best O
suited O
to O
bring O
to O
the O
fore O
an O
overall O
interest O
of O
humanity O
in O
the O
dangerous O
activity O
of O
the O
cultivating O
sorcerers O
of O
technical O
- O
scientific O
civilization O
, O
the O
independent O
individual O
sciences O
with O
their O
particularistic O
rationalities O
. O

The O
present O
task O
of O
sociology O
is O
to O
bring O
, O
through O
its O
interpretive O
translation O
and O
mediation O
services O
, O
the O
sciences O
, O
whose O
differentiation O
is O
irreversible O
, O
to O
the O
common O
denominator O
of O
a O
multidisciplinary O
discourse O
, O
which O
seeks O
to O
solve O
a O
binding O
question O
: O

how O
to O
prevent O
the O
disaster O
. O

The O
treatment O
of O
this O
existential O
question O
certainly O
does O
not O
succeed O
as O
a O
stroke O
of O
genius O
by O
a O
researcher O
or O
a O
specialist O
, O
but O
is O
only O
conceivable O
as O
a O
joint O
work O
of O
all O
sciences O
. O

From O
this O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
Enlightenment O
Science O
is O
the O
protagonist O
of O
a O
utopian O
program O
: O

that O
of O
overcoming O
disciplinary O
boundaries O
. O

The O
indifferent O
juxtaposition O
of O
university O
sciences O
is O
scientifically O
irresponsible O
and O
just O
as O

the O

The O
construction O

had O
first O
concealed O
their O

in O

, O
then O
divided O
the O
jewelry O
among O
themselves O
and O
sold O
piece O
by O
piece O

In O
the O
next O
decades O
the O
jewels O
appeared O
in O
various O
places O
and O
among O
the O
most O
diverse O
owners O
. O

Some O
parts O
were O
also O
considered O
completely O
lost O

were O

The O
eagle B-MISC
- I-MISC
peacock I-MISC
- O
fibel O
is O
the O
prototype O
of O
a O
fibelform B-MISC
, O
of O
which O
so O
far O
only O
three O
specimens O
are O
known O
, O
which O
, O
as O
reported O
by O
the O
upper O
conservator O
, O
also O
all O
come O
from O
Mainz B-LOC
. O

The O
common O
characteristic O
of O
these O
three O
disc O
fibulas O
is O
that O
the O
eagle O
is O
depicted O
with O
a O
peacock O
crown O
made O
of O
expanded O
wings O
. O

This O
mixture O
of O
eagle O
and O
peacock O
is O
based O
on O
a O
profoundly O
Christian O
meaning O
: O

The O
eagle O
symbolizes O
resurrection O
and O
ascension O
of O
Christ B-PER
, O
the O
peacock O
eternal O
life O
. O

That O
this O
crowned O
bird O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
regarded O
as O
an O
imperial O
sign O
of O
sovereignty O
and O
forerunner O
of O
the O
Staufian O
imperial B-MISC
eagle I-MISC
is O
also O
a O
reference O
to O
the O
temporal O
classification O
. O

Its O
body O
shape O
in O
frontal O
view O
, O
only O
the O
head O
in O
profile O
, O
obviously O
dates O
back O
to O
Islamic O
art O
in O
the O
10th O
century O
. O

Stylistically O
, O
the O
most O
beautiful O
and O
" O
most O
quality O
" O
of O
the O
three O
eagle O
fibulas O
has O
novel O
dimensions O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
formerly O
broad O
- O
edge O
framed O
small O
center O
, O
here O
the O
dominant O
large O
motif O
is O
surrounded O
by O
a O
now O
narrow O
edge O
. O

Another O
indication O
for O
the O
dating O
of O
this O
broken O
enamel O
fibula O
into O
the O
middle O
11th O
century O
are O
small O
flower O
stems O
made O
of O
gold O
wire O
at O
the O
roundings O
and O
pearl O
wire O
lines O
at O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
peacock O
wheel O
. O

Where O
and O
by O
whom O
the O
precious O
jewelry O
was O
made O
, O
can O
only O
be O
guessed O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
indicate O
Byzantine B-MISC
or O
Italian B-MISC
goldsmiths O
who O
were O
perhaps O
immigrating O
at O
that O
time O
or O
who O
had O
been O
living O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
for O
some O
time O
. O

Because O
Mainz B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
high O
Middle O
Ages O
called O
" O
diadem B-MISC
of I-MISC
the O
empire O
" O
, O
was O
in O
the O
Salierzeit B-MISC
the O
city O
with O
most O
royal O
stays O
and O
owned O
jewelry O
workshops O
of O
supraregional O
importance O
, O
whose O
traces O
can O
still O
be O
detected O
today O
on O
the O
old O
Rhine O
bank O
by O
lead O
waste O
, O
raw O
casts O
and O
semi O
- O
manufactures O
. O

Since O
the O
overwhelming O
number O
of O
jewels O
originates O
from O
the O
middle O
third O
of O
the O
11th O
century O
, O
it O
will O
be O
most O
likely O
to O
be O
attributed O
to O
Agnes B-PER
of I-PER
Poitou I-PER
, O
Mechthild B-PER
Schulze I-PER
- O
Dörlamm O
believes O
, O
especially O
since O

ring O
with O
the O
image O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
the O
Emperor O
Henry B-PER
III I-PER
, O
is O
preserved O
. O

With O
the O
gift O
certificates O
issued O
immediately O
after O
the O
wedding O
on O
extended O
lands O
and O
possessions O
, O
Henry B-PER
III I-PER
made O
them O
one O
of O
the O
most O
equipped O
queens O
in O
the O
history O
of O
the O
medieval O
empire O
; O
whether O
as O
an O
expression O
of O
his O
affection O
or O
foreseeing O
independent O
provision O
for O
a O
" O
foreign O
" O
ruler O
, O
is O
not O
handed O
down O
. O

That O
this O
wealthy O
Empress O
could O
have O
pledged O
her O
entire O
jewelry O
to O
a O
Jewish O
merchant O
by O
herself O
is O
unlikely O
. O

It O
would O
be O
conceivable O
that O
Agnes B-PER

as O

1066 O
- O
on O

16 O

- O
old O

heir O

Henry B-PER
IV I-PER
, O
with O
whom O
almost O
a O
year O
younger O
Bertha B-PER
of I-PER
Turin I-PER
- O
officially O
handed O
over O
the O
jewellery O
to O
her O
daughter O
- O
in O
- O
law O
for O
a O
gift O
. O

Bertha B-PER
almost O
belonged O
to O
the O
family O
, O
since O
she O
had O
already O
renounced O
the O
throne O
as O
a O
young O
girl O
and O
had O
withdrawn O
to O
an O
Italian B-MISC
monastery O
, O
where O
she O
no O
longer O
needed O
the O
representative O
jewelry O
. O

When O
Empress O
Bertha B-PER
now O
died O
in O
Mainz B-LOC
in O
1087 O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Henry B-PER
IV I-PER
equipped O
his O
third O
Rome O
campaign O
and O
had O
to O
fight O
again O
with O
money O
difficulties O
because O
of O
his O
numerous O
campaigns O
, O
it O
could O
have O
been O
possible O
that O
under O
these O
circumstances O
he O
has O
pledged O
the O
jewelry O
of O
his O
deceased O
wife O
to O
a O
reliable O
, O
rich O
Jew O

But O
when O

that O

that O

soloist O
once O

" O

That O
the O
cantor O
has O
its O
own O
string O

unusual O

For O
church O
concerts O
usually O
the O
musicians O
are O
bought O
together O
, O
which O
you O
need O
right O
now O
. O

Or O
you O
hire O
an O
entire O

That O

guarantee O
a O
good O

That O
very O

This O

body O
of O
the O
" O

the O
Disabled O

these O
days O
after O
a O

in O
Berlin B-LOC

Renowned O
gynaecologists O
, O
obstetricians O
, O
human O
geneticists O
and O
laboratory O
diagnostics O
had O
participated O

a O
number O
of O

demands O

As O
the O

, O
Professor O
Joachim B-PER
Wolfram I-PER
Dudenhausen I-PER
of O
the O
Rudolf B-ORG
Virchow I-ORG
Clinic I-ORG
of O
the O
Free B-ORG
University I-ORG
of O
Berlin O
, O
explained O
, O
the O
basically O
harmless O
, O
but O
costly O
test O
, O
when O
it O
provides O
evidence O
of O
genetic O
damage O
such O
as O
neural O
tube O
defects O
or O
for O
trisomies O
( O
as O
the O
formerly O
called O
down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
) O
, O
draws O
further O
elaborate O
and O
for O
the O
woman O
and O
the O
unborn O
not O
quite O
harmless O
investigations O
after O
itself O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
amniocentesis O
. O

A O
great O
many O
of O
these O
interventions O
are O
, O
according O
to O
the O
consultants O
, O
unnecessary O
and O
should O
be O
spared O
to O
pregnant O
women O
. O

Just O
as O
Triple O
Diagnostics O
is O
handled O
today O
, O
it O
too O
often O
provides O
evidence O
of O
a O
genetic O
risk O
that O
can O
not O
be O
confirmed O
with O
amniocentesis O
. O

According O
to O
Professor O
Dudenhausen B-PER
, O
these O
deficiencies O
have O
less O
to O
do O
with O
the O
difficulties O
of O
laboratory O
testing O
, O
with O
which O
biochemically O
three O
childlike O
substances O
are O
measured O
in O
maternal O
blood O
( O
alpha O
- O
fetoprotein O
, O
chorionic O
gonadotropins O
and O
ostriol O
) O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
test O
is O
affected O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
doctor O
often O
does O
not O
determine O
the O
exact O
age O
of O
the O
unborn O
child O
before O
taking O
the O
blood O
, O
and O
that O
the O
blood O
values O
then O
, O
when O
the O
child O
is O
older O
than O
suspected O
, O
pre O
- O
reflect O
a O
non O
- O
existent O
risk O
. O

The O
experts O
therefore O
require O
that O
the O
test O
be O
carried O
out O
using O
ultrasound O
only O
when O
the O
foetus O
is O
aged O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

As O
Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
added O
, O
a O
prior O
consultation O
of O
pregnant O
women O
is O
also O
indispensable O
. O

It O
was O
intended O
to O
make O
it O
clear O
to O
the O
expectant O
mothers O
that O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
test O
only O
detects O
a O
down B-MISC
syndrome I-MISC
in O
six O
out O
of O
ten O
cases O
and O
generally O
only O
a O
small O
part O
of O
all O
possible O
genetic O
damage O
is O

Prof. O
Dudenhausen B-PER
: O

" O
We O
can O
not O
give O
a O
guarantee O
certificate O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
healthy O
child O

" O

The O
suitability O
of O
the O
test O
under O

control O

Several O
series O
of O

are O
being O

at O
German B-MISC
hospitals O
, O
according O
to O
the O
University B-ORG
of I-ORG
Göttingen I-ORG
, O
where O
more O
than O
10,000 O
mothers O
have O
been O
tested O
so O
far O
. O

Concerning O
the O
possible O
consequence O
of O
abortion O
, O
the O
consultants O
also O
consider O
that O
the O
test O
is O
only O
applicable O
relatively O
late O
, O
between O
the O
15th O
and O
18th O
weeks O
of O

. O

Here O
they O
hope O
that O
the O
new O
development O
of O
a O
blood O
test O
, O
in O
which O
placenta O
proteins O
are O
examined O
, O
will O
bring O

The O
Boeing B-MISC
people I-MISC
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
number O
of O
engines O
of O
an O
aircraft O
is O
less O
important O
for O
its O
safety O
than O
was O
previously O

whether O

long O
overwater O

sufficiently O
safe O
, O
there O
were O
years O
of O
excited O
discussions O
. O

It O
immediately O
lights O
up O
that O
an O

has O

has O

, O
as O
the O
two O

engined O
in O
the O
aviator O
language O
are O
called O
, O
initially O
also O
had O
the O
approval O
authorities O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
the O
rule O
was O
that O
two O
- O
engined O
commercial O
aircraft O
would O
have O
to O
set O
up O
their O
route O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
could O
reach O
the O

alternate O
airport O
in O
at O
least O
60 O
minutes O
in O
the O
event O
of O
an O

. O

This O
meant O
that O
routes O
such O
as O
the O
North B-MISC
Atlantic I-MISC
line I-MISC
for O
two O
- O
beam O
jets O
such O
as O
the O
Airbusse B-MISC
or O
the O
Boeing-767 B-MISC
were O
at O
first O
largely O
closed O

The O
necessary O
detours O
via O
Greenland B-LOC
and O
Newfoundland B-LOC
cost O
additional O
flight O
time O
and O
made O
economic O
flight O
operation O
impossible O
. O

Under O
pressure O
from O
manufacturers O
and O
airlines O
, O
which O
promised O
economic O
benefits O
from O
the O
cost O
- O
effective O
use O
of O
two O
- O
beams O
on O
long O
- O

routes O
, O
these O
provisions O
were O

the O

In O

at O

For O

Meanwhile O

Such O

An O

joke O
about O
this O
sculpture O
by O
Belgian O
sculptor O
Constantin B-PER
Meunier I-PER
( O
1831 O
- O
1905 O
) O
reads O
as O
follows O
: O

" O
What O
does O
he O
actually O
introduce O
? O

The O
right O
leg O
, O
of O
course O

What O
else O
? O

The O
" O
debardeur O
" O
( O
dock O
worker O
) O
, O
as O
the O
figure O
created O
in O
1883 O
is O
called O
, O
stands O
with O
both O
legs O
in O
a O
crisis O
of O
art O
, O
to O
whose O
authenticity O
and O
social O
claim O
artists O
such O
as O
Meunier B-PER
or O
his O
far O
more O
famous O
companion O
van B-PER
Gogh I-PER
have O
wrestled O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
snugs O
of O
Art O
Nouveau O
, O
the O
rigid O
ideals O
of O
neo O
- O
classicism O
and O
the O
bohemian O
salon O
life O
seemed O
inappropriate O
to O
human O
reality O
that O
they O
experienced O
to O
the O
point O
of O
lying O
. O

Meunier B-PER
's I-PER
answer O
to O
this O
was O
the O
radical O
turning O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
, O
to O
model O
workers O
- O
figures O
. O

He O
was O
not O
concerned O
with O
the O
depiction O
of O
the O
misery O
in O
which O
the O
proletariat O
had O
fallen O
through O
the O
industrialization O
that O
was O
not O
yet O
socially O
acceptable O
at O
the O
time O
. O

He O
created O
realistic O
workers O
figures O
that O
embody O
with O
a O
certain O
pathos O
unbroken O
force O
, O
pride O
and O
dignity O

Such O

clearly O
took O

movement O

was O
in O
a O
frantic O

contrast O

would O

Our O

no O

so O
cloudy O
and O
there O
was O
no O

It O
is O
said O
that O
with O
the O
sewage O
treatment O
plant O
is O
only O
a O
rumor O
, O
and O
the O
waste O
water O
is O
now O
only O
directed O
to O
the O
neighboring O

where O
the O
fishing O
village O

We O

not O

the O
fish O

tastes O
fader O

and O
the O
waiters O
were O
getting O
more O
unfriendly O
and O
once O
even O
properly O
failed O
, O
when O
Heinz B-PER
got O
tasteful O
of O
goat O
meat O
and O
even O
wanted O
to O
pay O
accordingly O
. O

This O
time O
we O
have O
often O
been O
in O
" O
La B-LOC
Matalla I-LOC
" O
, O
the O
northern O
tip O
of O
our O
bay O
, O
which O
they O
have O
only O
now O
built O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
sweet O
, O
small O
bungalow O
village O
with O
diving O
school O
, O
disco O
, O
two O
restaurants O
and O
a O

Earlier O
there O
were O
some O
hideous O
barracks O
, O
which O
have O
blown O
them O
away O
along O
with O
a O
forest O
and O
some O
rocks O
that O
were O
in O
the O
way O
and O
then O
all O
the O
rubble O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
San B-LOC
Felipiano I-LOC
into O
the O
sea O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
also O
these O
annoying O
, O
ugly O
seabirds O
have O
disappeared O
, O
which O
used O
to O
nest O
there O
. O

Allegedly O
they O
are O
said O
to O
be O
very O
rare O
, O
but O
last O
year O
there O
were O
still O
enough O
of O
it O
to O
bring O
me O
with O
their O
screeching O
three O
nights O
in O
a O
row O
to O
sleep O
. O

Luckily O
they O
have O
fenced O
the O
whole O
bay O
around O
the O
" O
Plaja B-LOC
Paraiso I-LOC
" O
so O
that O
now O
this O
whole O
household O
no O
longer O
comes O
to O
the O
beach O
to O
sell O
or O
steal O
any O
stuff O
. O

It O
has O
become O
more O
and O
more O
, O
as O
it O
is O
said O
, O
because O
unemployment O
in O
the O
region O
is O
said O
to O
be O
over O
40 O
percent O

So O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
. O

There O
is O
truly O
enough O
to O
do O
in O
our O
holiday O
bay O

especially O
for O
people O
who O
are O
not O
too O
fine O

Although O

I O
have O
read O
that O
they O
are O
still O
looking O

Also O
with O

which O
lie O
around O

one O
could O
employ O
some O
willing O

work O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
believe O
how O

most O

are O

With O
the O
type O
that O
used O
to O

the O
understanding O
was O
so O
difficult O
that O
we O
had O
no O

go O

at O
all O
at O

No O

the O

A O

the O
Middle O

mentioned O

In O
1348 O
Johann B-PER
von I-PER
Goldstein I-PER
took O
over O
the O
estate O
, O
which O
henceforth O
bore O
his O
name O
. O

Johann B-PER
did O
not O
care O
very O
much O
about O
the O
building O
regulations O
of O
the O
Emperor O
Ludwig B-PER
: O

He O
wrote O
that O
within O

five O

zone O
around O
the O
city O
no O
castle O
- O
like O

could O

But O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
Johann B-PER

Goldstein I-PER
did O
. O

He O
moved O
walls O
around O
his O
new O

filled O
a O
fortification O
ditch O
with O
water O
that O
he O
diverted O
from O
the O
nearby O
Schwarzbach B-LOC

built O
a O
drawbridge O
along O
with O

. O

In O
brief O
: O

From O
the O
humble O
estate O
became O
a O
water O
castle O
that O
was O
to O
withstand O
a O
conquest O
. O

The O
Council O
of O
the O
City O
of O
Frankfurt B-LOC
was O
anything O

enthusiastic O
about O
the O
completed O
facts O
. O

The O
zealous O
castle O
builder O
nevertheless O
got O
away O
with O
it O
. O

Although O
the O
city O
fathers O
had O
the O
right O
to O
tear O
down O
the O
castle O
, O
they O
let O
Johann B-PER

Goldstein I-PER
grant O
it O
. O

After O
the O
death O
of O
the O
lord O
of O
the O
castle O
, O
the O
town O
acquired O
the O

for O
800 O

About O
150 O
years O
later O
, O
Margrave O
Achilles B-PER

: O

In O
the O

of O

in O
retreat O
in O
the O
Schmalkaldic B-MISC

after O

In O
his O
anger O
he O
let O
the O

, O
which O
from O
then O
on O
was O
broken O
. O

In O
the O
18th O

the O

until O
Jakob B-PER

He O
built O
it O

In O

The O
two O

this O
so O

called O

in O

Furetière B-PER

charming O

witty O
his O
narrative O

his O
literary O
expectations O

are O
actually O
two O
different O

finally O
one O
realizes O
that O
this O

had O
to O
stand O
a O
little O
behind O
next O
to O
the O
novel O
Comique O
of O
Scarron B-PER

This O

not O

because O

, O
the O

with O
the O

Next O

up O

that O

Today O
this O

no O

According O
to O
data O
provided O
by O

, O
what O
was O
true O
for O
the O
first O
attempts O
at O

this O

- O

also O

that O
over O

Thus O
, O
for O
the O
ecologically O
responsible O
car O
buyer O
in O
Europe B-LOC
a O
new O
offer O
arises O
, O
because O
still O
the O
simple O
rule O
is O
that O
every O
non O

is O
the O
best O
contribution O
to O

protection O
. O

With O
this O
Toyota B-MISC
concept I-MISC
for O
gasoline O
engines O
, O
the O
modern O
diesel O
engine O
will O
undoubtedly O
be O
given O
a O
new O
competitive O
edge O
, O
as O
its O
previous O
consumption O
advantage O
will O
shrink O
to O
almost O
zero O
in O
the O
usual O
everyday O

. O

This O
, O
in O
turn O
, O
will O
certainly O
spur O
diesel O
engineers O
to O
make O
new O
efforts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Toyota B-MISC

must O
be O
certified O

As O
consistent O

the O

In O
addition O

the O

And O
again O
it O

From O
the O

a O

by O
Dr. O

reported O
on O
how O

have O
dealt O
with O
this O
problem O
so O
far O
. O

Most O
of O
the O

surveyed O
in O

admitted O
that O
they O
have O
so O
far O
failed O
to O
answer O
relevant O
questions O
during O
the O
consultations O
for O
fear O
of O

the O

Other O

ignored O
the O
massive O
problem O
that O

be O
observed O
, O
as O
they O
did O
not O
see O
themselves O
able O
to O

If O
the O
legally O

binding O
suggestions O
of O
the O
AMA B-MISC

should O
fall O
on O
fertile O
soil O
in O
the O

, O
this O
passivity O
will O
not O
continue O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
even O
then O
, O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
age O
, O
race O
and O
social O
status O
of O
women O
, O
an O
anamnesis O
survey O
corresponding O
to O
the O
state O
of O
science O
will O
always O
include O
the O
question O
of O
the O
application O
of O
violence O
by O
the O
partner O
. O

If O
the O
question O
is O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
- O
and O
one O
in O
four O
women O
is O
attacked O
once O
in O
their O
lives O
by O
their O
intimate O
partner O
- O
then O
the O
American B-MISC
family O
doctors O
should O
immediately O
discuss O
with O
the O
affected O
women O
about O
their O
safety O
and O
hand O
them O
out O
written O
information O
material O
explaining O
the O

the O

According O

, O
Vice O
President O
of O
AMA B-ORG
, O
this O
recommendation O
of O
the O
state O

also O
necessary O
because O

Be O
that O
as O
it O

, O
Lersner B-PER
came O
from O

Kasseler B-MISC
jurist O

At O

played O
a O

In O
1715 O
he O
was O
elected O
to O

to O
his O

Three O
years O

, O
he O
was O
also O
admitted O

In O
1721 O
, O
Lersner B-PER
took O
over O
the O
post O
of O
younger O

But O
besides O
all O
the O

he O
had O
time O
to O
diligently O
continue O
collecting O
materials O

a O

In O
1723 O
he O

who O

the O

the O
conflict O
of O

: O

The O
old O
, O
traditional O
culture O
shapes O
India B-LOC
as O
well O
as O
the O
new O
, O
western O
. O

It O
became O
more O
illustrative O
, O
when O
Heidemarie B-PER
Pandey I-PER
read O
from O
the O
modern O
Indian B-MISC
women O
's O
novel O
" O
Anaro B-MISC
" O
by O
Marijul B-PER
Bhagat I-PER
, O
which O
the O
Pandey B-PER
couple O
translated O
from O
Indian B-MISC
into O
German B-MISC
. O

Here O
the O
focus O
was O
on O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
: O

Anaro B-PER
, O
the O
heroine O
of O
the O
novel O
, O
works O
as O
a O
maid O
, O
lives O
in O
the O
slums O
and O
has O
to O
care O
for O
her O
little O
daughter O
, O
which O
the O
father O
does O
not O
care O
about O
. O

But O
the O
insight O
into O
Indian B-MISC
everyday O
life O
remained O
short O
and O
a O
little O
superficial O
- O
especially O
because O
the O
audience O
probably O
lacked O
background O
information O

Thus O
, O
from O
the O

reading O

itself O

by O
Prof. O
Peter B-PER
Neuhaus I-PER
for O
three O

, O
which O
temporarily O

toxic O

like O
a O

While O

an O

this O
takes O

the O

. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
researchers O
have O
tested O
the O
apparatus O
only O
in O
animal O
experiments O
. O

Later O
the O
device O
should O
stand O
next O
to O
the O
hospital O
bed O
and O
be O
connected O
to O
the O
human O
bloodstream O
via O
hoses O
. O

The O
blood O
flows O
through O
a O
replaceable O
component O
that O
consists O
of O
a O
mesh O
of O
fine O
plastic O
tubes O
. O

The O
pig O
liver O
cells O
adhere O
to O
the O
tubes O
. O

They O
filter O
out O
of O
the O
blood O
pollutants O
that O
are O
either O
fed O
from O
the O
outside O
or O
arise O
during O
metabolism O
in O
the O
body O
. O

These O
include O
, O
for O
example O
, O
phenols O
and O
ammonia O
. O

Both O
substances O
lead O
to O
brain O
damage O
. O

The O
component O
works O
on O
average O
for O
a O
week O
. O

Then O
it O
must O
be O
exchanged O
for O
a O
new O
one O
with O
fresh O
pig O
liver O
cells O
. O

The O
researchers O
have O
had O
great O
difficulty O
to O
grow O
enough O
cells O

far O
. O

According O
to O
Gerlach B-PER
, O
this O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
Berlin O

doctors O
had O
succeeded O
. O

At O
least O
60 O
percent O

the O
cells O
of O
a O

should O
be O
isolated O

admits O
Chairman O
Joseph B-PER
Pongratz I-PER
unreservedly O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Hanau B-MISC
modelmakers O
attach O
great O
importance O
to O
a O
fine O
difference O
: O

In O
no O
case O
do O
they O
want O
to O
apply O
to O
pursue O
their O
leisure O
activities O
with O
obstinateness O
. O

That O
would O
hardly O
be O
the O
right O
word O
to O
characterize O
the O
passion O
of O
the O
hobbyists O
and O
inventors O
. O

If O
the O
men O
( O
whose O
domain O
of O

is O
still O
) O
enthusiastically O
tell O
of O
technical O
details O
, O
proudly O
demonstrate O
their O

marvels O
or O
follow O
with O
remote O

in O

banished O

this O

rather O
something O

about O

of O
about O

according O
to O
the O

claim O
in O
the O
form O
of O
" O

during O

. O

Two O

For O

Joseph B-PER

With O

Unlike O
the O

the O

not O

. O
" O

In O
the O

they O
would O
otherwise O
have O
too O
bad O

" O
, O
explains O
Pongratz B-PER
. O

Flying O
is O
a O
chapter O
in O
itself O
anyway O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
it O
is O
not O

Josef B-PER
Hartinger I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG

is O
convinced O
that O
people O
in O
the O
West O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC
would O
accept O
a O
smoking O
ban O
in O

" O

The O
problem O

is O
there O
, O
" O
says O
the O
deputy O
local O
head O
and O
passionate O
smoker O
: O

" O
At O
the O
main O

I O
have O
already O
been O
politely O
admonished O
, O
when O
I O
forgot O
to O
make O
out O
my O

" O

Fortunately O
, O
smoking O
among O
young O
people O
and O
students O
decreases O
significantly O
. O

According O
to O
Hartinger O
, O
the O
CDU B-MISC
Group I-MISC
also O
wants O
to O
support O
a O
request O
that O
the O
SPD B-ORG
will O
submit O

the O
local O

meeting O
next O

Thereafter O
, O
in O

it O
is O
intended O
to O
be O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
made O
an O
important O
contribution O
to O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
interests O
of O
people O
and O
the O
environment O
by O
developing O
principles O
for O
the O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
displaced O
persons O
or O
other O
affected O
persons O
and O
the O
environmental O
impact O
of O
such O
projects O
for O
projects O
financed B-MISC
by O
the O
World O
Bank O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
Government O
of B-LOC
India I-LOC
has O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
system O
to O
reduce O
environmental O
damage O
from O
public O
projects O
. O

Despite O
all O
these O
positive O
factors O
, O
however O
, O
we O
fear O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
very O
serious O
. O

We O
have O
discovered O
serious O
errors O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC

We O
think O
that O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
, O
as O
they O
are O
planned O
and O
implemented O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
are O
flawed O
, O
that O
relocation O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
all O
those O
who O
have O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
relocate O
through O
the O
project O
is O
not O
possible O
under O
the O
given O
circumstances O
and O
that O
the O
environmental O
effects O
of O
the O
project O
are O
not O
carefully O
considered O
or O
adequately O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
is O
just O
as O
responsible O
for O
the O
situation O
that O
has O
arisen O
as O
the O
debtor O

The O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
intended O
to O
bring O
drinking O

to O
Kutch B-LOC

other O
drought O

areas O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC

to O
irrigate O
a O
large O
area O
of O
this O
state O
as O
well O
as O
two O
districts O
in O
Rajasthan B-LOC
. O

This O
requires O
a O
large O
reservoir O
on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
river I-LOC
and O
an O
extensive O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O

The O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-LOC
dam I-LOC

which O
is O
currently O
being O
built O
on O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
river I-LOC
at O
Navagam B-LOC
and O
Kevadia B-LOC
, O
will O
build O
up O
water O
to O
a O
full O
reservoir O
height O
of O
455 O
feet O
( O
about O
151 O
meters O
, O
that O
is O
) O
. O

It O
will O
put O
37 O

under O
water O
in O
the O
three O
states O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC

The O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-LOC
dam I-LOC
, O
together O
with O
the O
planned O
projects O
, O
is O
further O
upstream O

so O
that O
it O
distributes O
9.5 O
million O
acre O
feet O
of O
water O
from O
the O
river O
Narmada B-LOC
into O
a O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
. O

The O
channel O
itself O
is O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
its O
capacity O
, O
the O
largest O
in O
the O
world O
and O
will O
extend O
over O
a O
length O
of O
450 O

to O
the O

The O

initially O
250 O

, O
towards O
the O

, O
at O
the O

Rajasthan B-LOC
, O
the O

is O
still O
100 O

The O

has O
a O
total O

of O
75,000 O

A O
total O
of O
about O
80 O

needed O
for O
this O
, O
more O
than O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O

The O
Sardar O

Sarovar B-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
water O

projects O
ever O
undertaken O
, O
their O
impact O
covering O
a O
vast O
area O
and O
affecting O
a O
large O
number O
of O
people O
, O
in O
particular O
tribal O
members O
. O

At O
least O
100 O
000 O
people O
in O
245 O
villages O
live O
in O
the O
area O
that O
will O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
flood O
. O

In O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
almost O
all O
affected O
tribal O
members O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
live O
" O
illegal O
" O
there O
, O
i.e. O
they O
have O
no O
legal O
title O
for O
their O
country O
. O

Also O
in O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
live O
in O
the O
flood O
area O
thousands O
of O
tribal O
members O
, O
of O
which O
also O
many O
have O
no O
land O
titles O
. O

In O
Madhya B-LOC

there O
are O
also O
many O
villages O
with O
Hindus O
in O
which O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
conventional O

pursue O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
100,000 O
people O
living O
in O
the O
flood O
region O
, O
there O
are O
probably O
about O
140 O
000 O
farmers O
affected O
by O
the O
canal O
and O
irrigation O
system O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
there O
are O
several O
thousand O
more O
people O
who O
live O
downstream O
, O
below O
the O
dam O
, O
and O
whose O
lives O
will O
also O
be O
significantly O
changed O
. O

In O
1985 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
entered O
into O
loan O
and O
bond O
negotiations O
with O
the O
Government O
of O
India B-LOC
and O
the O
Governments O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
Madhya B-LOC

and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
for O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
Damme O
and O

Within O
these O
treaties O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
treated O
only O
the O
people O
as O
" O

" O
- O
with O
the O
right O
to O
resettlement O
and O

- O
whose O
villages O
are O
flooded O
. O

So O
our O
first O
task O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
measures O
taken O
to O
resettle O
and O

these O
people O
. O

The O
overall O
task O
for O
our O
investigation O
refers O
to O
persons O
who O
are O
" O
displaced O
by O
the O
reservoir O
and O
the O
infrastructure O
" O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
were O
asked O
by O
President O
Conable B-PER
to O
include O
in O
our O
investigation O
also O
considerations O
on O
the O
status O
of O

for O

The O
idea O
of O
containment O
of O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
goes O
back O
many O
years O
, O
but O
a O
realization O
was O
made O
more O
difficult O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
river O
passes O
through O
three O
states O
, O
which O
could O
not O
agree O
on O
a O
division O
of O
project O
costs O
and O
benefits O
. O

In O
1969 O
, O
the O
dispute O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
Narmada B-MISC
Water I-MISC
Court I-MISC
, O
which O
was O
established O
under O
the O
Interstate B-MISC

Act I-MISC

In O
1979 O
it O
announced O
its O
award O
. O

The O
arbitral O
tribunal O
, O
as O
the O
states O
had O
agreed O
, O
went O
out O
of O
28 O
million O
acre O
feet O
of O
water O
as O
the O
river O
of O
Narmada B-LOC
, O
which O
should O
be O
distributed O
. O

It O
alluded O
to O
nine O
million O
acre O
feet O
water O
Gujarat B-LOC
- O
the O
water O
should O
be O
channelled O
into O
the O
canal O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
this O
state O
( O
an O
additional O
0.5 O
million O
acre O
feet O
should O
be O
delivered O
to O
Rajasthan B-LOC
) O
. O

The O
hydroelectric O
utility O
was O
divided O
among O
the O
three O
shore O
states O
. O

The O
conditions O
on O
which O
the O
ruling B-PER
of O
the O

was O
based O
included O
a O

In O
1985 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG

A O
further O
request O
of O
over O

350 O

was O
made O
for O

It O
must O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
World B-ORG

considered O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
our O

carried O
out O

The O
World B-ORG

has O
provided O

with O
all O
the O

has O
entered O
into O
the O
most O
engaged O

has O
given O
us O
the O
freedom O
of O

that O
we O
needed O

We O
do O
not O
know O
any O

any O

with O
such O
a O

for O
a O

, O
no O
matter O
how O
controversial O
it O
was O
. O

The O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
's O
determination O
to O
do O
this O
is O
evidence O
of O
its O
determination O
to O
understand O
what O
went O
wrong O
with O
the O
projects O
. O

Similarly O
, O
we O
received O
support O
from O
the O
government O
of O

the O

In O
the O
past O
, O
people O
who O
lived O
in O
the O

were O
often O
forced O
to O
settle O
in O
the O
construction O

, O
often O
without O
appropriate O

This O
has O
happened O
in O
both O

developing O
countries O
. O

In O
such O
cases O
, O
compensation O
was O
often O
only O
cash O
, O
and O
this O
money O
was O
very O
often O
not O
sufficient O
, O
rarely O
- O
if O
at O
all O
- O
enough O
to O
buy O

) O

In O
1979 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-MISC
Water I-MISC
Court I-MISC
in O
India B-LOC
itself O
established O
that O
displaced O

2 O

( O
5 O

of O

In O
addition O
, O
the O

found O
that O
adult O

( O
i.e. O
18 O

should O
be O
treated O
by O

this O

India B-LOC
and O
the O
three O
states O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC

represent O
the O
position O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O

, O
land O
should O
apply O
only O
to O

have O
a O

i.e. O
possess O
what O

In O
their O
opinion O
it O
was O
not O
the O

that O

for O
which O
they O

In O

the O

made O
it O
clear O
that O
it O

not O
only O
be O
about O

also O
about O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
it O
requires O
that O

at O

regain O
their O
previous O
standard O

developed O
principles O

It O
ensured O
that O

did O

in O

no O

about O
the O

In O
1985 O
, O
when O
the O
credit O

were O
signed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
basis O
for O
the O
draft O

and O
compensation O
for O

The O
number O
of O

who O
would O
be O
affected O
was O
not O
known O
; O
the O
extent O
of O
likely O

had O
never O
been O
considered O
; O
the O

had O
been O
overlooked O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
had O
been O
no O

those O
threatened O
by O
the O
projects O

There O
were O
still O
benchmarks O
to O
check O
success O
or O

So O
there O
was O
also O
no O
adequate O
relocation O

with O
the O
result O
that O
human O
costs O
could O
not O
enter O
into O
the O

as O
a O
factor O
. O

Measures O
to O
reduce O
such O
costs O
could O
not O
be O
designed O
in O

with O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
parties O
concerned O
. O

When O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
signed O
the O
contracts O
for O
the O
Sardar O
- O
Sarovar B-LOC
dam I-LOC
, O
it O
took O
over O
the O
definition O
of O
land O
- O
owners O
, O
i.e. O
those O
who O
did O
not O
include O
farmers O
without O
land O
titles O
, O
as O
laid O
down O
by O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
dealt O
with O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
adult O
sons O
should O
receive O
land O
, O
not O
. O

This O
allowed O
the O
majority O
of O
displaced O
tribal O
members O
to O
be O
deprived O
of O
their O
possessions O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
did O
not O
make O
any O
separate O
provision O
in O
the O
Arrangement O
for O
the O
Channel O
for O
the O
persons O
who O
would O
be O
displaced O
or O
otherwise O
affected O
by O
the O
Channel O
. O

Only O
those O
affected O
by O
flooding O
or O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
the O
project O
were O
defined O
as O
displaced O
persons O
, O
although O
in O
1980 O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
had O
already O
admitted O
that O
relocation O
is O
necessary O
in O
the O
event O
of O
displacement O
by O
sewer O
and O
irrigation O
systems O
. O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
announced O
comprehensive O
relocation O
principles O
, O
which O
must O
generally O
be O
applied O
to O
forced O
relocations O
, O
and O
in O
1991 O
it O
announced O
special O
relocation O
principles O
for O
tribal O
members O
. O

These O
statements O
repeated O
the O
principles O
established O
a O
decade O
earlier O
and O
further O
differentiated O
them O
. O

These O
principles O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
reflect O
the O
general O
adoption O
of O
new O
human O
rights O
concepts O
. O

They O
recognise O
that O
large O
- O
scale O
projects O
, O
especially O
in O
rural O
, O
forest O
and O
settlement O
areas O
, O
can O
force O
- O
proliferate O
people O
as O
much O
as O
war O
or O
natural O
disasters O
. O

They O
focus O
on O
people O
displaced O
by O
progress O
in O
development O
and O
demand O
that O
the O
human O
rights O
of O
displaced O
persons O
be O
respected O
in O
each O
project O
. O

According O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
, O
these O
are O
rights O
that O
can O
not O
be O
overridden O
by O
national O
sovereignty O
or O
interests O
. O

Such O
considerations O
may O
justify O
a O
project O
, O
but O
according O
to O
ILO B-MISC
107 I-MISC
they O
do O
not O
justify O
the O
cancellation O
of O
these O
human O
rights O
by O
a O
project O
. O

The O
governments O
of O
the O

There O
is O
, O
however O
, O
disagreement O
about O
interpretation O

Gujarat B-LOC
, O
with O
4700 O
displaced O
families O
, O
adopted O
a O
policy O
in O
1988 O
according O
to O
which O
every O
land O
- O
owner O
is O
offered O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O

It O
also O
offers O
2 O
hectares O
to O
those O
who O
are O
classified O
as O
" O
landless O
" O
; O
tribal O
members O
and O
others O
who O
may O
work O
land O
without O
land O
title O
, O
thus O
receive O
2 O
hectares O
of O
land O

According O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
, O
adult O

also O
receive O
two O
hectares O
. O

The O
Government O
of O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
the O
Governments O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
agree O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
's I-LOC
policy O
goes O
beyond O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
and O
the O
World B-MISC

Maharashtra B-LOC

where O
about O
3000 O

and O
Madhya B-LOC

, O
with O
23 O

, O
are O
willing O
to O
allocate O
two O

land O

But O
they O
are O
not O
willing O
to O
give O
two O
hectares O
for O
adult O

. O

Neither O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
nor O
Maharashtra B-LOC
recognizes O
any O
rights O
for O
land O
compensation O
to O
people O
without O
land O

. O

These O
differences O
in O
national O
policies O
led O
to O
a O
dispute O
over O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
award O
and O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
's O
credit O

. O

The O
dispute O
may O
seem O
technical O
, O
but O
its O
outcome O
depends O
on O
the O
opportunities O
for O
thousands O
of O
forced O

The O

of O
the O
World B-ORG

referred O
to O

to O

by O

their O
favour O

which O
they O
had O
prior O
to O

( O
Emphasis O
by O
authors O
) O

How O
can O
this O
be O
ensured O
in O
the O
case O
of O
displaced O
persons O
who O
know O
only O
agriculture O
as O
employment O
and O
in O
which O
it O
represents O
the O
heart O
of O
their O
social O
, O
economic O
and O
cultural O
life O
, O
if O
not O
by O
providing O
them O
with O
land O
for O
processing O
during O
relocation O
? O

In O
1984 O
, O
the O
Narmada B-LOC
Control O
Authority O
, O
which O
had O
been O
set O
up O
to O

" O
For O
tribal O
members O
there O
is O
no O
more O
effective O
rehabilitation O
than O
to O
provide O
land O
for O
livelihood O
. O
" O

We O
have O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
the O
only O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
their O
standard O
of O
living O
improves O
or O
remains O
the O
same O
. O

The O
result O
, O
when O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
are O
called O
landless O
, O
means O
that O
people O
who O
work O
the O
land O
they O
consider O
to O
be O
their O
own O
, O
become O
landless O
workers O
. O

This O
is O
not O
rehabilitation O
. O

It O
does O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
live O
at O
least O
as O
well O
as O
before O
. O

The O
tribal O
members O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
are O
very O
conscious O
of O
this O
and O
what O
it O
means O
for O
them O
when O
they O
are O
relocated O
as O
landless O
agricultural O
workers O
. O

When O
we O
visited O
Bamni B-LOC
, O
a O
tribal O
village O
in O
Maharashtra B-LOC
, O
people O
told O
us O
: O

" O
We O
are O
peasants O
, O
not O
workers O
. O
" O

In O
our O
view O
, O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
have O
not O
met O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
's O
credit O
conditions O
, O
as O
they O
have O
not O
managed O
to O
provide O
adequate O
land O
for O
the O
rehabilitation O
of O
people O
without O
land O
titles O
. O

The O
states O
argue O
that O
, O
after O
the O
award O
and O
the O
agreements O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
all O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
where O
both O
landowners O
and O
landless O
displaced O
persons O
are O
to O
receive O
two O
hectares O
of O
irrigated O
land O
. O

Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
and O
Maharashtra B-LOC
therefore O
expect O
that O
many O
displaced O
people O
will O
settle O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
resettlement O
plan O
of O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
actually O
contains O
only O
10 O
% O
of O
the O
land O
needed O
for O
resettlement O
. O

But O
many O
displaced O
people O
do O
not O
want O
to O
move O
to O
Gujarat B-LOC
for O
reasons O
related O
to O
language O
, O
culture O
and O
other O
ties O
to O
the O
region O
. O

For O
many O
of O
them O
, O
this O
would O
be O
a O
major O
cultural O
change O

Both O
according O
to O
the O
ruling O
of O
the O
Arbitration O
Court O
and O
according O
to O
the O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
, O
displaced O
persons O
have O
the O
right O
to O
be O
resettled O
in O
their O
own O
state O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
been O
quite O
successful O
in O
the O
implementation O
of O
resettlements O
in O
the O
last O
eighteen O
months O
, O
but O
so O
far O
Gujarat B-LOC
has O
only O
settled O
about O
3000 O
families O
. O

Resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
of O
so O
much O
more O
displaced O
people O
- O
perhaps O
15,000 O
families O
- O
from O
Maharashtra B-LOC
and O
Madhya B-LOC
Pradesh I-LOC
, O
would O
be O
an O
enormous O
task O
for O
Gujarat B-LOC
and O
would O
nevertheless O
significantly O
burden O
its O
limited O
resources O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
not O
only O
about O
relocation O
, O
it O
is O
also O
about O
rehabilitating O
the O
people O
. O

The O
states O
may O
be O
able O
to O
organize O
the O
physical O
move O
of O
thousands O
of O
families O
to O
land O
in O
Gujarat B-LOC
, O
but O
we O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Gujarat B-LOC
will O
be O
able O
to O
rehabilitate O
them O
all O
. O

( O

The O
only O
relocation O
policy O
that O
all O
three O
states O
must O
apply O
is O
that O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

But O
this O
policy O
of O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
not O
been O
followed O

The O

were O
not O
developed O
in O

paid O
some O

But O
since O
1985 O
these O
people O
have O
also O
been O
covered O
by O
the O
contracts O
with O
the O
World B-ORG

Their O
right O
to O
land O
should O
have O
been O
recognised O
seven O
years O
ago O
, O
but O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
failed O
to O
ensure O
recognition O
of O
these O
rights O
by O
Gujarat B-LOC
as O
part O
of O
the O
treaties O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
provision O
of O
adequate O
land O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
recently O
urged O
India B-LOC
, O
but O
without O
insisting O
on O
it O
, O
that O
India B-LOC
and O
the O
states O
should O
comply O
with O
the O
1979 O
arbitral O
ruling O
on O
adult O

; O
India B-LOC
should O
establish O
principles O
to O
meet O
the O
comprehensive O

of O
the O
World B-MISC

and O
ensure O

However O
, O
the O
World B-ORG
Bank I-ORG
has O
not O
only O
failed O
to O
bring O
the O

and O
the O

into O
force O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
channel O
, O
it O
has O
failed O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
has O
not O
laid O
down O
binding O
rules O
in O
its O
Treaty O
with O

which O
requires O
the O

What O
about O
the O

who O

in O
the O

of O
the O

The O
construction O
of O
the O

will O
affect O
140 O

of O

perhaps O
13 O

no O

To O
the O

The O
number O
of O

affected O
is O
controversial O
in O

so O
much O
is O
clear O
: O

Takeover O
of O
land O
under O
the O
Land O

has O
often O

that O

below O
the O
real O
cost O
of O

For O
us O
, O
the O
responsibility O
on O
this O
point O
is O
clearly O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
World B-ORG

It O
has O

The O
history O

the O

impact O
of O
Sardar B-LOC

Sarovar I-LOC
is O
a O
history O
of O
non O
- O
granted O
permits O
. O

There O
is O
no O
comprehensive O
document O
on O
the O
impact O
. O

The O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
environmental O
problems O
and O
solutions O
are O
unknown O
. O

This O
contributes O
significantly O
to O
the O
controversy O
surrounding O
the O
project O
. O

As O
with O
resettlement O
and O
rehabilitation O
, O
this O
fact O
has O
put O
our O
investigation O
into O
a O
difficult O
situation O
. O

In O
order O
to O
finish O
our O
work O
, O
we O
had O
to O
collect O
basic O
ecological O
information O
to O
describe O
the O
likely O
impact O
of O
the O
project O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
of O
the O
project O
. O

This O
work O
should O
have O
been O
done O
by O
others O
before O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
projects O
. O

( O

. O

) O

We O
found O
inconsistencies O
in O
the O
basic O
hydrological O
information O
related O
to O
this O
work O
( O
i.e. O
at O
dam O
and O
canal O
, O
i.e. O
) O
. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
analysed O
the O
water O
flow O
data O
and O
made O
our O
own O
analysis O
. O

We O
came O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
there O
is O
good O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
projects O
will O
not O
work O
as O
planned O
. O

The O
problems O
relate O
to O
the O
frequency O
and O
time O
of O
the O
stationary O
currents O
as O
well O
as O
the O
capacity O
of O
the O
dam O
and O
the O
canal O
to O
store O
and O
distribute O
water O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
Sardar B-LOC
Sarovar I-LOC
, O
upstream O
, O
downstream O
and O
in O
the O
catchment O
area O
will O
therefore O
be O
different O
from O
those O
currently O
assumed O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
the O
Sardar B-MISC
Sarovar I-MISC
projects I-MISC
are O
built O
upstream O
as O
planned O

A O
realistic O
operational O
analysis O
on O
which O
an O
environmental O
sustainability O
assessment O
could O
be O
based O
is O
missing O
. O

This O
has O
alerted O
us O
and O
it O
should O
also O
alert O
others O
, O
especially O
in O
a O
mega O

The O
deficiencies O
that O
we O
identified O
in O
the O

of O
damage O
in O
the O

field O
also O
extend O
to O
the O
catchment O
area O
of O
the O
project O
. O

Although O
extensive O
studies O
are O
missing O
, O
we O
found O
that O
there O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
problems O
with O
dulling O

salinization O
. O

Pre O

calculations O

the O

for O
the O

as O

We O
can O
only O
come O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
future O
problems O
in O
the O

area O
as O
a O
whole O
will O
be O
very O
similar O
to O

But O
it O

not O
until O

that O
we O
found O
statements O
by O
the O
World B-MISC

that O
the O

carried O
out O
without O

He O
describes O
various O

that O

Any O

spent O
a O

The O

No O

wants O
this O

But O
we O
warn O
against O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
can O
be O

more O
waste O
to O
continue O
now O
without O
knowing O
the O

We O
have O
come O

the O
conclusion O
that O
it O
would O
be O
irresponsible O

to O
draw O
up O
a O
number O
of O
recommendations O

in O

of O
the O
errors O
that O
the O
project O
is O
so O
obvious O
to O
us O

Therefore O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
wisest O
decision O
for O
the O
World B-ORG

would O
be O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O

reconsider O
them O

Its O
photovoltaic O
system O
produces O
direct O
current O
, O
which O
is O
initially O
converted O
into O
alternating O
current O
via O
a O
so O
- O
called O
inverter O
and O
then O
fed O
into O
the O
grid O
. O

In O
the O
first O
three O
weeks O
, O
the O
average O
electricity O
production O
per O
day O
was O
15 O
kilowatt O
hours O
( O

. O

The O
top O
result O
in O
one O
day O
, O
says O
Kirchhof B-PER
proudly O
, O
were O
21 O
kWh O
. O

This O
is O
twice O
as O
much O
as O
the O
family O
consumes O
on O
average O
per O
day O
. O

What O
remains O
, O
goes O
into O
the O
public O
network O
: O

Each O
kilowatt O
hour O
, O
which O
Kirchhoff B-PER
feeds O
, O
he O
receives O
from O
the O
EAM B-ORG
16,61 O
Pfennig O
. O

However O
, O
the O
EAM B-ORG
collects O
about O
one O
and O
a O
half O
times O
as O
much O
( O
25 O
Pfennig O
) O
, O
if O
Kirchhof O
's O
own O
production O
is O
not O
enough O
and O
he O
has O
to O
tap O
the O
public O
network O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
get O
rich O
by O
trading O
with O
the O
EAM B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
to O
him O
either O
: O

Because O
already O
ten O
years O
ago O
the O
family O
set O
itself O
the O
goal O
to O
meet O
its O
energy O
demand O
with O
environmentally O
friendly O
regenerative O
raw O
materials O
. O

It O
all O
started O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
Heino B-PER
Kirchhof I-PER
recognized O
his O
ecological O
" O
sins O
" O
: O

During O
the O
construction O
of O
his O
house O
he O
had O
installed O
about O
an O
electric O
underfloor O
heating O
. O
" O

Electricity O
" O
, O
that O
became O
clear O
to O
him O
only O
in O
hindsight O
, O
" O
is O
far O
too O
precious O
to O
heat O
with O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
in O
1982 O
he O
exchanged O
the O
underfloor O
heating O
for O
four O
tiled O
stoves O
, O
which O
are O
fed O
with O
dry O
beech O
wood O
" O
. O
" O

Not O
so O
comfortable O
, O
" O
he O
admits O
, O
" O
but O
more O
ecologically O
valuable O
. O
" O

Around O
three O
years O
later O
, O
the O
Kirchhofs B-PER
installed O
solar O
panels O
that O
heat O
the O
water O
for O
showering O
, O
washing O
and O
rinsing O
. O

Such O
solar O
systems O
for O
domestic O
water O
heating O
are O
relatively O
cheaper O
than O
those O
with O
photovoltaics O
, O
comparing O
the O
price O
and O
the O
ecological O
benefits O
: O

" O
With O
10 O
000 O
Marks O
" O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
anticipates O
, O
" O
a O
photovoltaic O
plant O
can O
be O
financed O
with O
half O
a O
kilowatt O
, O
which O
saves O
about O
0.5 O
tons O
of O
carbon O
dioxide O
. O
" O

With O
the O
same O
amount O
, O
however O
, O
a O
complete O
domestic O
water O
heating O
system O
could O
also O
be O
paid O
. O

And O
the O
save O
considerably O
more O
carbon O
dioxide O
one O
. O

Therefore O
, O
solar O
thermal O
energy O
is O
primarily O
promoted O
in O
Hesse B-LOC
. O

According O
to O
the O
Ministry B-ORG
of O
the O
Environment O
, O
the O
country O
grants O
up O
to O
3000 O
marks O
for O
such O
solar O
installations O
, O
but O
not O
more O
than O
30 O
percent O
of O
the O
costs O
. O

However O
, O
this O
support O
programme O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old O

The O
Kirchhofs O
paid O
their O
plant O
for O

water O
heating O
from O
their O
own O

Heino B-PER

However O
, O
the O

to O
generate O
the O

needed O
for O
the O

with O
the O

That O
's O
why O
he O
invested O

to O
build O
a O
small O
sun O
- O
fed O

This O
year O
Kirchhof B-PER
had O
the O

significantly O
. O

A O
North B-MISC
Hessian I-MISC

added O
a O
five O

to O
the O
first O
. O

The O

has O
cost O
around O
130 O

marks O
. O

A O
costly O
commitment O
to O
the O
environment O
. O

For O
Kirchhoff B-PER
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
also O
financially O
viable O
because O
it O
belongs O
to O
those O
150 O

which O

been O
increased O
to O

expired O
at O
the O

Until O
then O
, O

on O
their O

could O
apply O
for O

of O
70 O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
received O
1000 O
marks O
per O

of O

from O
the O
EAM B-ORG
. O

Less O
all O

, O
he O
had O

about O
33,000 O

Kirchhof B-PER
is O
, O

with O

not O
only O
because O
it O

brought O
him O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
is O
not O
completely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
: O

Although O
the O
facilities O
for O
2500 O
German B-MISC
builders O
have O
become O
cheaper O
by O
the O
promotion O
and O
perhaps O
first O
financeable O
for O
some O
. O

However O
, O
the O
programme O
did O
not O
provide O
for O
a O
real O
breakthrough O
in O
environmentally O
friendly O
energy O
technology O
, O
because O
the O
market O
had O
not O
been O

. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
Kirchhof B-PER
considers O
the O
support O
guidelines O
to O
be O
worth O
improving O
. O

About O
because O
the O
American B-MISC

For O

the O

used O
as O
a O

In O

By O
the O
beginning O

, O
he O
hopes O

the O

building O
will O
connect O
a O
9.5 O

with O
the O
house O

The O

partly O
glazed O
from O
the O
floor O
to O
the O
ceiling O
and O
later O
serve O
as O
foyer B-PER

. O

Because O
the O
chapel O
will O
be O
used O
for O
concerts O

other O
cultural O
events O
in O
the O
future O
. O

The O

Until O

pass O
some O

That O
the O
old O

, O
private O

had O
already O
established O
on O

At O

whose O
owner O
had O
to O
give O
up O

violent O

in O
the O

But O
only O
after O
a O
sum O
of O
5.9 O

for O
the O
entire O

had O
been O
decided O

one O
examined O
the O

again O

It O
proved O
to O
be O
dilapidated O

although O
it O
had O
initially O
looked O

at O
least O
from O
the O
outside O
– O
" O
properly O
" O
as O
Schmitteckert O
assured O
. O

The O
ceiling O
had O
to O
be O
supported O
because O
of O
the O
danger O
of O
collapse O
. O

If O
the O
additional O
cost O
application O
is O
approved O
, O
the O
project O
manager O
estimates O
, O
it O
will O
take O
another O
one O
year O
before O
the O
new O
building O
can O
be O
purchased O
. O

The O
7.3 O
million O
mark O
of O
renovation O
of O
the O
three O
buildings O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
completed O
in O
the O
course O
of O
next O
year O
. O

The O
new O
Haus O
Marktstraße B-LOC
58 O
should O
then O
have O
significant O
advantages O
over O
the O
old O
walls O
. O

This O
could O
only O
have O
been O
inadequately O
isolated O
against O

. O

The O

on O
the O

receives O
higher O

The O
highest O
hurdle O
: O

In O
the O
event O
of O
a O
vote O
, O
two O
thirds O
of O
the O
tenants O
must O
agree O
to O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
to O
the O
cooperative O
. O

Whether O
this O
result O
can O
be O
achieved O
is O
completely O
open O
. O

In O
November O
the O
tenants O
are O
supposed O
to O
decide O
in O
secret O
vote O
on O
the O
further O
fate O
of O
the O

. O

Should O
this O
vote O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
, O
the O
Supervisory O
Board O
of O
the O

will O
be O
able O

final O

at O

The O
other O
conditions O
of O
the O
Minister O
of O
Housing O
can O
be O
more O
easily O
met O
by O
the O
cooperative O
: O

It O
must O
join O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Treaty I-MISC
" O
. O

It O
provides O
that O
all O
vacant O
dwellings O
must O
be O
notified O
to O
the O
Housing B-ORG
Office I-ORG
and O
that O
new O
tenants O
may O
be O
assigned O
by O
the O
Authority O
. O

This O
condition O
is O
easy O
to O
meet O
, O
said O
the O
board O
member O
of O
the O
cooperative O
, O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Another O
condition O
of O
the O
Minister O
is O
to O
raise O
the O
rental O
price O
piece O
by O
piece O
up O
to O
a O
square O
meter O
price O
of O
8.50 O
marks O
. O

The O
aim O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
cooperative O
can O
work O
profitably O
and O
that O
the O
country O
does O
not O
have O
to O
face O
a O
bankruptcy O
for O
the O
accumulated O
debts O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
, O
according O
to O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
, O
the O
cooperative O
also O
lacks O
a O
so O
- O
called O
" O
maintenance O
report O
" O

In O
principle O
, O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
clarify O
whether O
a O
small O
cooperative O
can O
manage O
the O
stock O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
of O
only O
1072 O
dwellings O
at O
all O
profitably O
. O

Should O
all O
conditions O
be O
met O
, O
the O
home O
settlement O
may O
change O
owner O
for O
the O
purchase O
price O
of O
about O
80 O
million O
marks O
. O

The O
sum O
shall O
be O
as O
follows O
: O

48.3 O
million O
mark O
is O
given O
by O
the O
country O
of O
the O
cooperative O
as O
an O
interest O
- O
free O
grant O
. O

This O
sum O
was O
received O
in O
1986 O
by O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimstätte I-ORG
for O
the O
acquisition O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
from O
the O
bankruptcy O
estate O
of O
the O
New O
Homeland O
. O

So O
the O
money O
is O
simply O
" O
passed O
on O
" O
. O

The O
missing O
sum O
of O
about O
32 O
million O
marks O
is O
currently O
covered O
by O
mortgages O
, O
which O
should O
also O
be O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
new O
cooperative O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
rent O
increase O
serves O
to O
gradually O
replace O
the O
primary O
school O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
repay O
the O
national O
subsidy O
. O

The O
tenant O
cooperative O
currently O
has O
about O
350 O
members O
. O

It O
promises O
itself O
of O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
above O
all O
a O
" O
tenancy O
close O
administration O
" O
, O
as O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
explained O
. O
" O

There O
are O
no O
alienated O
working O
conditions O
, O
the O
tenants O
are O
not O
numbers O
and O
in O
the O
long O
term O
they O
will O
determine O
the O
business O
policy O
" O
, O
Schneider B-PER

Sufficient O
control O
bodies O
were O
installed O
, O
they O
assured O
that O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
tenants O
would O
again O
be O
exposed O
to O
uncertainties O
such O
as O
had O
arisen O
after O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
the O
previous O
owner O
New O
Homeland O
. O

However O
, O
not O
all O
tenants O
seem O
convinced O
of O
this O
. O

They O
are O
satisfied O
with O
the O
management O
of O
the O
home O
settlement O
by O
the O
Nassauische B-ORG
Heimstätte I-ORG
and O
see O
through O
the O
vote O
and O
the O
discussion O
about O
the O
cooperative O
solution O
brought O
unnecessary O
unrest O
to O
the O
Sachsenhäuser B-MISC
Wohnviertel O
. O

The O
uncertainty O
of O
many O
tenants O
also O
contributes O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
maintenance O
status O
of O
the O
apartments O
is O
not O
good O
. O

Only O
recently O
the O
gas O
pipelines O
in O
the O
settlement O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
the O
grid O
because O
the O
money O
for O
a O
remediation O
was O
missing O
. O

The O
members O
of O
the O
cooperative O
are O
nevertheless O
optimistic O
: O

" O
We O
will O
work O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
tenants O
in O
the O
required O
majority O
support O
the O
takeover O
, O
" O
said O
Hannelore B-PER
Schneider I-PER
. O

Will O
it O
be O
possible O
to O
inspire O
almost O
67 O
percent O
of O
tenants O
for O
the O
first O
establishment O
of O
a O

cooperative O
after O

Already O
around O

the O

- O
the O

of O
the O

it O
clear O
: O

The O

has O
moved O

( O

During O
the O
recent O
session O
of O
the O
Parliament O
, O
the O
district O
politicians O
also O
dealt O
with O
these O
two O
issues O
, O
which O
have O
for O
some O
time O
been O
causing O
fierce O
disputes O
between O
the O

With O
the O
support O
of O
their O
city O
councillor O
Ulrich B-PER
Baier I-PER
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
first O
tried O
to O
enforce O
an O
application O
in O
the O
local O
council O
, O
in O
which O
they O
demanded O
that O
the O
" O
expulsion O
" O
of O
the O
scene O
from O
the O
Taunusanlage B-MISC
remains O
until O
enough O
new O
facilities O
are O
created O
for O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC
drug O
addicts O
. O

So O
far O
, O
according O
to O
the O
applicant O
Michael B-PER
Krämer I-PER
( O
Greens B-ORG
) O
, O
the O
evacuation O
of O
the O
Taunus B-MISC

has O
only O
the O
consequence O
that O
the O
" O
scene O
" O
is O
relocated O
to O
the O
surrounding O
districts O
. O

In O
the O
Taunus B-MISC
plant I-MISC
the O
impairment O
of O
residents O
remained O
" O
limited O
" O
, O
but O
the O
relocation O
had O
effects O
in O
adjacent O
areas O
- O
for O
example O
in O
the O
station B-LOC
district I-LOC
, O
according O
to O
Krämer B-PER
. O

Ulrich B-PER
Baier I-PER
brought O
numbers O
into O
the O
discussion O
: O

A O
total O
of O
about O
600 O
drug O
addicts O
are O
involved O
. O

And O
even O
if O
half O
of O
them O
were O
" O
foreigners O
" O
who O
could O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
the O
surrounding O
area O
, O
there O
were O
still O
300 O

from O
Frankfurt B-LOC

For O
those O
there O
are O
" O
not O
enough O

, O
" O
stressed O
Baier B-PER

But O
the O
SPD B-ORG

factions O
do O
not O
think O
much O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
' O
arguments O
: O

The O

the O
Taunus B-MISC

said O
Helgo B-PER
Müller I-PER

. O

Alexander B-PER
Zollmann I-PER

agreed O
that O
this O

not O

The O

was O

On O

broadly O
in O

Although O

were O
postponed O
for O
a O

at O
the O
request O
of O
the O

, O
the O

were O
not O

in O
principle O
, O
opposed O
to O
the O

of O
the O

They O
share O
the O
fears O
of O
the O
other O
members O
of O
the O
local O
council O
that O
the O
smaller O

creates O
a O
strong O

the O

The O

Later O

rotted O

In O

The O

plays O
a O
significant O
role O
in O
this O
respect O
: O

In O
the O
course O

the O
opening O

, O
the O
German B-MISC

is O
gaining O
in O
importance O
in O
Europe B-LOC

But O
it O
is O
also O
about O
the O
confrontation O
with O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
identity O
. O

After O
all O
, O
this O
region O
was O
German B-MISC
until O
the O
30 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
war O
and O
then O
until O
the O

of O

- O
a O
story O
with O
a O
full O
- O
fledged O
Franco O
- O
German B-MISC
character O
. O

Now O
that O
borders O
in O
Europe B-LOC
are O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
important O
, O
new O
opportunities O
are O
opening O
up O
: O

The O
Alsatian B-MISC
is O
a O
Frenchman B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
a O
European O
with O
his O
own O
, O
regional O
, O
historically O
rooted O
identity O
, O
whose O
cultural O
symbol O
is O
bilingualism O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
still O
a O
long O
way O
to O
go O
until O
such O
a O
mission O
statement O
is O
achieved O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
it O
is O
a O
matter O
of O
irrevocably O
reversing O
a O
trend O
that O
started O
after O
the O
war O
and O
which O
in O
traditional O
German O
- O
speaking B-MISC
Alsace B-LOC
made O
German B-MISC
largely O
a O
foreign O
language O
. O

Suppressed O
, O
even O
forbidden O
were O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
the O
High B-MISC
German I-MISC
as O
its O
written O
form O
of O
expression O
not O
. O

But O
the O
framework O
conditions O
ensured O
that O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
and O
the O
German B-MISC
were O
pushed O
back O
more O
and O
more O
. O

Thus O
many O
local O
and O
street O
signs O
were O
Frenchized B-MISC
. O

The O
official O
correspondence O
could O
soon O
after O
the O
war O
only O
be O
conducted O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

In O
the O
kindergartens O
at O
first O
even O
Alsatian B-MISC
homeland O
songs O
disappeared O
from O
the O
program O
. O

German B-MISC
teaching I-MISC
at O
schools O
has O
been O
reduced O
. O

In O
the O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
, O
the O
popular O
sports O
section O
had O
to O
appear O
in O
French B-MISC

In O
not O
a O
few O
families O
existed O
and O
exist O
two O
language O
worlds O
: O

Parents O
talk O
in O
the O
dialect O
, O
the O
conversations O
with O
the O
children O
take O
place O
in O
French B-MISC
. O

The O
consequence O
: O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
quickly O
developed O
into O
a O
dominant O
colloquial O
language O
. O

The O
German B-MISC
- O
language O
editions O
of O
the O
regional O
expenditures O
lost O
and O
are O
still O
losing O
circulation O
. O

The O
vast O
majority O
of O
younger O
people O
are O
no O
longer O
powerful O
in O
Alsace B-MISC
. O

In O
the O
restaurant O
the O
patron O
German B-MISC
guests O
, O
who O
do O
not O
speak O
French B-MISC
, O
can O
often O
still O
help O
linguistically O
, O
which O
is O
usually O
not O
possible O
of O
the O
young O
waitress O
or O
seller O
. O

Already O
in O
the O
1970s O
, O
ECEurope B-LOC
did O
not O
remain O
ineffective O
- O
German B-MISC
teaching I-MISC
at O
schools O
was O
again O
expanded O
. O

The O
French B-MISC
and O
Baden B-MISC
school O
authorities O
agreed O
on O
a O
program O
to O
promote O
the O
playful O
learning O
of O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
neighbour O
" O
already O
in O
primary O
school O
age O
, O
mutual O
class O
visits O
included O
, O
and O
the O
resonance O
in O
the O
schools O
was O
enormous O
. O

But O
in O
the O
sense O
of O
a O
real O
" O
bilinguisme O
" O
associations O
such O
as O
the O
René O
- O
Schickele B-ORG
circle I-ORG
, O
which O
makes O
itself O
for O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
- I-LOC
Lorraine I-LOC
, O
had O
to O
feel O
for O
a O
long O
time O
still O
as O
a O
lonely O
caller O
in O
the O
desert O
. O

But O
with O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
Wall O
in O
Germany B-LOC
and O
the O
Iron B-MISC
Curtain I-MISC
in O
Europe B-LOC
it O
has O
become O
almost O
chic O
in O
the O
social O
life O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
to O
stand O
up O
for O
" O
le O
bilinguisme O
" O
. O

The O
most O
visible O
expression O
of O
this O
development O
: O

In O
more O
and O
more O
places O
the O
French B-MISC
street O
names O
are O
provided O
with O
Alsatian B-MISC
subtitles O
. O

So O
now O
in O
Mülhausen B-LOC
is O
called O
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Marechaux I-LOC
" O
also O
" O
Schmidgass B-LOC
" O
, O
in O
Colmar B-LOC
the O
" O
Rue B-LOC
des I-LOC
Prêtres I-LOC
" O
with O
the O
for O
German B-MISC
ears O
somewhat O
disrespectful O
sounding O
title O
" O
Pfaffegassle B-LOC
" O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
core O
issue O
is O
language O
teaching O
in O
schools O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
teaching O
of O
German B-MISC
at O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
schools O
is O
further O
intensified O

In O
the O
school O
year O
that O
has O
now O
expired O
, O
three O
hours O
per O
week O
outside O
the O
usual O
German B-MISC
lessons I-MISC
were O
spoken O
in O
different O
subjects O
in O
a O
model O
project O
of O
around O
60 O
classes O
in O
30 O
primary O
schools O
. O

A O
spectacular O
success O
was O
achieved O
by O
the O
ABCM B-MISC
citizens I-MISC
' O
initiative O
, O
which O
has O
already O
joined O
about O
800 O
parents O
and O
teachers O
: O

Supported O
by O
subsidies O
from O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
Regional O
Council O
, O
the O
two O
General O
Councils O
and O
even O
the O
EC B-ORG
, O
with O
the O
practical O
help O
of O
some O
local O
authorities O
, O
six O
really O
bilingual O
preschool O
classes O
could O
now O
be O
set O
up O
, O
in O
which O
13 O
hours O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
13 O
hours O
of O
German B-MISC
are O
spoken O
. O

This O
first O
significant O
progress O
towards O
bilinguisme O
demonstrates O
that O
the O
proponents O
of O
bilingualism O
are O
still O
facing O
a O
stubborn O
opponent O
- O
and O
that O
is O
to O
say O
" O
Paris B-LOC

He O
is O
present O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
National O
School O
Authority O
. O

Since O
1982 O
, O
a O
law O
has O
in O
principle O
allowed O
equal O
education O
in O
French B-MISC
and O
the O
respective O
regional O
language O
, O
if O
parents O
so O
wish O
. O

This O
directive O
was O
implemented O
in O
the O
Basque B-LOC
Country I-LOC
and O
in O
Brittany B-LOC
, O
but O
not O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

The O
real O
concern O
of O
ABCM B-ORG
is O
the O
establishment O
of O
bilingual O
classes O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
official O
state O
school O
system O
. O

The O
municipal O
council O
of O
Mülhausen B-LOC
also O
took O
a O
decision O
to O
this O
effect O
. O

However O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
hearing O
, O
ABCM B-ORG
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
make O
a O
first O
move O
with O
bilingual O
kindergartens O
on O
a O
private O
basis O
. O

But O
even O
these O
initiatives O
are O
resisted O
in O
some O
places O
, O
the O
promised O
subsidies O
of O
the O
EC B-ORG
and O
of O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
local O
authorities O
can O
not O
be O
fully O
used O
, O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
opportunity O
: O

At O
times O
, O
the O
local O
authorities O
did O
not O
provide O
any O
rooms O
, O
with O
ABCM B-ORG
suspects O
that O
the O
State O
School O
Authority O
sometimes O
also O
exerts O
pressure O
on O
mayors O
. O

In O
the O
most O
spectacular O
dispute O
in O
Powdersheim B-LOC
the O
educators O
of O
the O
state O
school O
, O
with O
the O
back O
of O
a O
teacher O
's O
association O
, O
resist O
that O
in O
the O
same O
building O
in O
one O
( O
otherwise O
unused O
! O

) O
Rooms O
a O
bilingual O
ABCM B-MISC
preschool I-MISC
class I-MISC
has O
been O
accommodated O
. O

The O
Mairie O
and O
the O
school O
administration O
met O
in O
court O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
matter O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
settled O
. O

After O
all O
: O

" O
State O
" O
and O
" O
private O
" O
children O
can O
now O
use O
the O
same O
toilet O
and O
also O
play O
together O
in O
the O
breaks O
- O
which O
initially O
did O
not O
go O
. O

" O
Haut B-ORG
Comité I-ORG
" O
- O
President O
Goetschy B-PER
complains O
that O
there O
are O
still O
too O
few O
dialect O
broadcasts O
on O
radio O
and O
television O
. O

Concerned O
, O
the O
politician O
is O
that O
the O
recent O
reform O
of O
the O
French B-MISC
Constitution O
explicitly O
states O
that O
French B-MISC
is O
the O
" O
language O
of O
the O
Republic O
" O
, O
but O
that O
no O
mention O
is O
made O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
regional O
languages O
. O

The O
proponents O
of O
bilingualism O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
are O
probably O
not O
wrong O
with O
their O
assumption O
that O
behind O
disinterest O
and O
persistent O
resistance O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
there O
is O
the O
fear O
of O
a O
creeping O
" O
Germanization B-MISC
" O
of O
Alsace B-LOC
, O
before O
a O
" O
drift O
" O
of O
this O
region O
, O
even O
the O
will O
not O
to O
reveal O
the O
dominance O
of O
French B-MISC
and O
thus O
also O
of O
the O
political O
priority O
of O
centralism O
in O
any O
way O
. O

But O
even O
the O
most O
decisive O
supporters O
of O
" O
bilinguisme O
" O
clearly O
define O
themselves O
as O
French B-MISC
, O
but O
also O
as O
Europeans B-MISC
and O
Alsatians B-MISC
, O
who O
want O
to O
preserve O
and O
rebuild O
a O
social O
and O
cultural O
regional O
identity O
in O
a O
growing O
Europe B-LOC
through O
bilingualism O
. O

So O
not O
only O
in O
" O
Paris B-LOC
" O
there O
is O
resistance O
to O
overcome O
. O

In O
Alsace B-LOC
itself O
, O
contradictions O
also O
arise O
. O

Thus O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-ORG
City I-ORG
Council I-ORG
to O
subtitle O
60 O
streets O
and O
squares O
with O
their O
historical O
German B-MISC
names O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
European B-MISC
city I-MISC
, O
met O
with O
unexpectedly O
violent O
protest O
, O
which O
was O
reflected O
in O
numerous O
letters O
from O
the O
readers O
of O
ebbing O
Strasbourg B-MISC
citizens O
and O
in O
thoughtful O
comments O
in O
the O
media O
. O

According O
to O
the O
critics O
, O
German B-MISC
is O
not O
only O
the O
language O
of O
the O
Strasbourg B-MISC
student O
Goethe B-PER
, O
but O
also O
the O
language O
of O
Hitler B-PER
. O

There O
it O
became O
apparent O
that O
the O
Nazi B-MISC
time I-MISC
in O
Alsace B-LOC
certainly O
continues O
as O
a O
trauma O
. O

For O
months O
this O
dispute O
lasted O
until O
finally O
a O
compromise O
was O
found O
: O

The O
signs O
on O
the O
streets O
and O
squares O
do O
not O
get O
any O
German B-MISC
, O
but O
Alsatian B-MISC
additional O
names O
- O
as O
already O
in O
many O
places O
in O
Alsace B-LOC
. O

Ultimately O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Alsatian B-MISC
supporters O
of O
bilingualism O
can O
see O
themselves O
in O
the O
unstoppable O
trend O
of O
time O
. O

The O
practical O
experience O
and O
requirements O
of O
the O
EC B-MISC
internal I-MISC
market I-MISC
alone O
encourage O
the O
tendency O
to O
bilinguisme O
. O

After O
all O
, O
around O
60 O
000 O
Alsatians B-MISC
are O
already O
working O
in O
the O
Greater O
Basel B-LOC
area O
as O
border O
commuters O
in O
Baden B-LOC
between O

and O

as O
well O
as O

and O
foremost O
, O
and O
there O
are O
spoken O
either O

. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
more O

more O

not O

And O
look O
at O
this O
: O

Surprisingly O
, O
with O
the O
start O
of O
the O
new O

year O
in O
September O
, O
the O

it O

The O

that O
little O
hope O

First O
of O

, O
it O
is O
important O
for O
them O

" O

Then O
the O

take O
this O
seriously O
and O
continue O
to O
support O

" O

For O
the O
young O
parliamentarians O
have O
recognized O
one O
thing O
: O

Without O
support O
from O
peers O
, O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
does O
not O
go O
any O
further O
. O
" O

We O
are O
really O
just O
the O
representatives O
. O

We O
can O
only O
pass O
on O
what O
youths O
bring O
to O
us O
. O
" O

This O
view O
is O
also O
so O
vehemently O
expressed O
by O
them O
that O
they O
do O
not O
want O
" O
such O
a O
mentality O
to O
emerge O
: O

" O
We O
have O
our O
officials O
now O
and O
they O
're O
already O
doing O
it O
. O
" O

Only O
a O
few O
suggestions O
have O
reached O
the O
Youth O
Parliament O
so O
far O
. O

Perhaps O
because O
the O
young O
people O
themselves O
had O
to O
penetrate O
the O
depths O
of O
local O
politics O
first O
. O

And O
as O

this O

now O

says O

shares O
the O
SPD B-MISC

Beate B-PER

It O
considers O
it O
crucial O
that O
" O
now O
also O
young O

articulate O
what O
they O
need O
" O
. O

That O

not O
so O
much O
that O
has O

come O
, O
" O
says O
the O
CDU B-MISC
Group I-MISC
leader I-MISC
Franz B-PER
Kaunzner I-PER
. O

He O
sees O
the O
youth O
parliament O
primarily O
as O
a O
training O
room O
: O

" O
Sometimes O
if O
you O
look O
at O
how O
great O
ignorance O
is O
" O
, O
the O
participation O
in O
the O
youth O
parliament O
with O
young O
people O
can O
certainly O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
opinion O
. O

What O
he O
admonishes O
, O
however O
, O
is O
continuity O
: O

" O
If O
they O
send O
a O
different O
representative O
each O
time O
, O
it O
wo O
n't O
work O
. O
" O

The O
young O
people O
have O
also O
recognized O
this O
: O

They O
do O
not O
want O
to O
pay O
homage O
to O
the O
principle O
of O
rotation O
. O

But O
even O
they O
will O
grow O

. O

In O
addition O
, O
their O
term O
of O

What O
comes O
after O
, O
even O
the O
young O

do O
not O
know O
. O

They O
strongly O
resist O
to O
regard O

had O
been O
working O

The O
background O
: O

For O
the O
home O
opened O
in O
March O
1991 O
- O
not O
least O
because O
of O
the O
housing O
situation O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
- O
not O
enough O
elderly O
caregivers O
and O
elderly O
caregivers O
could O
be O
found O
. O

Planned O
on O
the O
approximately O
200 O
square O
meter O
plot O
are O
seven O
apartments O
. O

According O
to O
Viola B-PER
, O
negotiations O
with O
the O
municipal O
authorities O
are O
already O
underway O
. O

The O
" O
most O
important O
concern O
" O
of O
Alfred B-PER
Viola I-PER
: O

The O
Housing O
Office O
should O
promote O
construction O
in O
1993 O
. O

The O
Frankfurt B-MISC
Association O
hopes O
that O
all O
preparations O
will O
be O
completed O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O

. O

The O
planning O
department O
does O
not O
see O
any O
further O
ways O
of O
providing O
housing O
for O
nurses O
. O

The O
local O
housing O
agency O
could O
not O
reserve O
flats O
at O
a O
flat O
rate O
as O
this O
was O
not O
possible O
by O
law O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
new O
buildings O
and O
conversions O
of O
buildings O
, O
the O
department O
will O
always O
check O
in O
the O

whether O

can O
not O

Also O
for O
Klaus B-PER

the O

an O
extraordinary O

Of O

for O
him O

: O

" O
If O

Westend B-LOC

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
will O
not O

that O
there O
is O
a O
" O
basic O
consensus O
" O
with O
the O

of O
the O
local O

Because O
rumors O
had O
already O
surfaced O
on O
the O
spot O
that O
the O
municipal O
administrative O
office O
wanted O
to O
shake O
again O
at O
principles O
of O
the O
new O
traffic O
management O
. O

When O
the O
Tempo-30 O
sign O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
Westend B-LOC
, O
no O
office O
wants O
to O
speculate O
about O
it O

As O

Anton B-PER

had O
already O

that O
the O

by O
no O

prescribe O
a O

and O
thus O
also O
justify O
the O
rejection O
of O

With O
a O
speed O
reduction O
it O
is O
not O
done O
, O
Winter B-PER
said O
beyond O

Instead O
, O
the O

would O
have O
to O
be O
enlarged O

Only O
then O
would O
pedestrians O
be O
safer O

A O
view O
that O
also O
supported O
Günther B-PER
Boege I-PER
. O

But O
the O
SPD B-MISC

could O
not O
get O
along O
with O
the O
idea O
for O
the O

. O

A O

of O
the O

will O
only O
be O
useful O
, O
argued O

was O

six O

Even O

" O

Hilde B-PER

she O

: O

The O
Nieder B-MISC

The O

at O
the O

highly O
desirable O
for O

but O
difficult O
to O
realize O
. O

The O
existing O
gym O
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
too O
small O
years O

, O
should O
be O
demolished O
for O
this O
purpose O

As O
a O
result O
, O

would O
be O
disturbed O

for O
at O

two O

. O

In O
the O

, O
no O

Moreover O
, O
the O
Frankfurt B-MISC

director O
Sylvia B-PER

believes O
that O
, O
due O
to O
the O

in O

, O
no O
intact O

, O
even O
if O

, O
should O
be O

Especially O
in O

, O
where O
in O
any O
case O
only O

are O
available O
, O
such O
an O
action O
would O
exacerbate O
the O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
larger O

on O
the O

of O
the O
Michael B-LOC

The O

who O
do O

would O
take O
a O

get O
there O
. O

With O
a O

of O
only O
45 O

this O

not O

As O
the O

In O
this O
context O
, O
Weiser B-PER
also O
pointed O
to O
the O
wild O
growth O
of O

According O

the O

this O
could O
not O

, O

only O
to O
a O

however O
, O
the O
coordination O
of O
the O

favored O
by O
the O
CDU B-ORG
with O
the O

only O
obscures O
the O
hard O
reality O
, O
since O
the O
agreed O
design O
regulation O
explicitly O
provides O
for O
its O
extension O
if O
necessary O

Thus O
, O
it O

for O

The O

The O
CDU B-ORG
in O

wants O
now O
finally O
clarity O
: O

In O
the O
recent O
session O
of O
the O
district O
parliament O
, O
they O
called O
for O
an O
immediate O
public O
hearing O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O

Wolfgang B-PER

oracled O
, O
" O
we O
get O
there O
the O

" O
. O

With O
his O
fear O
, O
Hescher B-PER
is O
not O
alone O
: O

Recently O
, O
a O
preliminary O
draft O
for O
the O
development O
plan O
appeared O
in O
the O
district O
, O
since O
then O
the O
wildest O
rumors O
circulate O

In O
order O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
world O
, O
the O
Christian B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
now O
call O
for O
a O
citizen O
hearing O
, O
as O
it O
prescribes O
paragraph O
3 O
of O
the O
Construction O
Code O
. O

A O
demand O
that O
the O
Preungesheim O
Citizens O
' O
Initiative O
recently O
issued O
in O
a O
letter O
to O
Mayor O
Andreas B-PER
von I-PER
Schoeler I-PER
. O

The O
only O
catch O
: O

Such O
a O
hearing O
already O
took O
place O
in O
March O
1983 O
, O
then O
still O
under O
the O
former O
CDU B-MISC
- I-MISC
Magistrate I-MISC
. O

And O
by O
law O
, O
the O
developer O
is O
only O
obliged O
to O
hold O
a O
hearing O
. O

However O
, O
Wolfgang B-PER
Hescher I-PER
is O
convinced O
that O
a O
new O
meeting O
is O
necessary O
, O
as O
since O
the O
change O
of O
government O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
, O
" O
the O
basic O
principles O
of O
planning O
have O
changed O

Thus O
, O
the O
red B-MISC
- I-MISC
green I-MISC
city O
lords O
want O
to O
build O
more O
than O
twice O
as O
many O
apartments O
as O
their O
predecessors O
- O
around O
5000 O
people O
will O
live O
in O
the O
73 O
- O
hectare O
bend O
one O
day O
. O

The O
" O
condensed O
construction O
" O
, O
said O
Hescher B-PER
, O
" O
is O
however O
only O
possible O
if O
a O
rail O
- O
bound O
vehicle O
will O
drive O
into O
the O
area O
" O
. O

The O
possible O
route O
, O
however O
, O
is O
still O
being O
discussed O
. O

For O
the O
Conservatives O
, O
it O
is O
therefore O
clear O

The O
" O
many O
inconsistencies O
" O
can O
only O
be O
clarified O
in O
a O
citizen O
's O
hearing O
. O

The O
social B-ORG
democrats I-ORG
see O
this O
differently O
: O

" O
We O
want O
a O
local O
council O
special O
meeting O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
" O
said O
Group O
leader O
Günther B-PER
Häfner I-PER
. O

This O
would O
be O
enough O
to O
make O
planning O
" O
more O
transparent O
for O
citizens O
" O
. O

A O
hearing O
under O
paragraph O
3 O
would O
lead O
to O
further O
" O
one O
and O
a O
half O
years O
delay O
" O
, O
fears O
Jörg B-PER
Stelzer I-PER
( O
SPD B-ORG
) O
, O
" O
because O
then O
we O
will O
come O
back O
from O
the O
draft O
phase O
to O
the O
preliminary O
draft O
phase O
. O
" O

The O
2500 O
apartments O
in O
the O
Preungesheimer O
Beuge O
would O
therefore O
have O
to O
wait O

The O
real O
reason O
for O
the O
CDU B-MISC
application I-MISC
is O
anyway O
a O
completely O
different O
, O
suspicious O
SPD B-MISC

Häfner B-PER
: O

" O
As O

Often O
enough O

they O
also O
contribute O
to O
the O
fact O
that O

exhausted O
in O
that O

to O

In O

Since O
the O

also O

above O
all O
want O
to O

in O

it O
is O
not O
enough O
" O
only O
" O

to O
sing O

but O
with O
pieces O
from O
musicals O
and O

also O
the O
youth O
to O
inspire O
for O
the O

song O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
singers O
see O
themselves O
as O
victims O
of O
the O
dilemma O
that O
a O
composer O
only O
composes O
if O
he O
also O
knows O
that O
this O
work O
is O
bought O
from O
him O
. O

And O
this O
, O
according O
to O
Claus O
- O
Peter B-PER
Blaschke I-PER
, O
is O
still O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
with O
modern O

. O

The O
trend O
of O
many O
choirs O
still O
goes O
there O
to O
sing O
( O
and O
buy O
) O
what O
you O
know O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
clubs O
have O
little O
literature O
that O
is O
appealing O
to O
teenagers O
, O
explains O
Blaschke B-PER
and O
gets O
swarmed O
about O
the O
choral O
adaptations O
of O
the O
Beatles B-MISC
Song I-MISC
" O
Let O
it O
be O
" O
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
new O
compositions O
also O
allowed O
a O
stronger O
examination O
of O
the O
present O
day O
. O
" O

When O
I O
see O
our O
natural O
misery O

then O
I O
can O
sing O
, O
Oh O
, O
You O

, O
and O
the O
whole O
has O
a O
meaning O

But O
it O
could O
also O
be O
a O
contemporary O

to O
write O
a O

about O
the O

But O
does O
he O
only O
if O
he O
can O

it O
too O

Only O
if O
a O

is O
found O
for O
this O
, O
the O

open O
themselves O
to O
the O
youth O
and O
care O
for O
them O
, O
the O
choir O
singing O
in O
his O
opinion O
can O
have O
a O
future O
. O

Some O
choirs O
in O
the O
circle O
he O
also O
prophesies O
their O
extinction O
. O

Other O
choirs O
, O
such O
as O
the O
international O

from O
Oberursel B-LOC
or O
the O
" O
Stierstädter B-ORG
Sparrows I-ORG
" O
, O
let O
him O
look O
hopefully O
into O
the O
future O
. O

Especially O
since O
the O
singing O
for O
him O
beyond O
the O
purely O
musical O
also O
promotes O
the O
" O
community O
sense O
" O
. O

In O
our O
society O
, O
the O

represents O
in O
his O
eyes O
a O
cell O
of O
personal O
contacts O
: O

the O
group O
dynamic O
aspect O
as O
an O
" O
important O
by O

of O

But O
he O
also O
finds O
that O
" O
singing O
frees O
" O
and O
most O
hobby O

" O
is O
simply O
fun O

Even O
more O
fun O
it O
would O
have O
to O
make O
them O
to O
produce O
" O
quality O
" O
, O
so O
his O
conviction O

The O
openness O
he O
called O
for O
must O
also O
mean O
the O
courage O
to O
make O
new O
, O
difficult O
and O
unknown O
pieces O

But O
that O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
spectrum O
of O

clear O
, O
is O
different O
from O

In O
any O

the O

" O

We O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O

can O
not O
close O
themselves O
to O
this O

since O
the O

continue O
a O
tradition O
that O
took O
its O
beginning O

the O

The O

to O

Many O
working O

were O
created O

after O
which O
the O
choral O

of O

Even O
today O
the O

feel O
this O

their O

the O

At O

the O

to O

operated O
a O
few O
minutes O
after O
the O

In O
the O
explanatory O
statement O
of O
the O
request O
, O
the O
Group O
welcomed O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
FVV B-ORG
reduced O
the O
train O
sequence O
of O
S O
7 O
to O
30 O
minutes O
on O
weekdays O
. O

This O
significantly O
reduces O
the O
journey O
time O
from O
the O
main O
and O
south B-LOC
station I-LOC
to O
Fechenheim B-LOC
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
the O
time O
gained O
at O
Mainkur B-LOC
station O
is O
lost O
again O
, O
as O
the O
passengers O
there O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
" O
44 O
" O
. O

The O
proposal O
was O
adopted O
unanimously O
by O
the O
district O
politicians O
. O

The O
agreement O
of O
the O
local O
advisory O
council O
to O
a O
second O
SPD B-MISC
initiative I-MISC
was O
not O
quite O
as O
unanimous O
. O

In O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
proposal O
, O
the O
Social B-ORG
Democrats I-ORG
demanded O
that O
the O
44 O
buses O
run O
every O
10 O
, O
every O
20 O
minutes O
until O
8 O
p.m. O
and O
every O
half O
hour O
thereafter O
. O

For O
a O
denser O
clock O
of O
the O
" O
44ers O
" O
nevertheless O
as O
many O
places O
with O
passengers O
are O
occupied O
, O
smaller O
buses O
are O
to O
be O
used O
. O

The O
local O
council O
agreed O
to O
the O
request O
against O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
CDU B-MISC
Group I-MISC
. O

As O
its O
chairman O
Dieter B-PER
Kunzler I-PER
said O
, O
the O
44 O
is O
anyway O
a O
" O
spirit O
bus O
" O
, O
which O
is O
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
hours O
hardly O
used O
. O

He O
called O
it O
" O
not O
particularly O
useful O
" O
to O
let O
the O
bus O
roll O
even O
more O
often O
" O
through O
the O
narrow O
streets O
of O
Fechenheim B-LOC
" O
. O

This O
is O
no O
argument O
against O
a O
shorter O
time O
clock O
, O
said O
Albrecht B-PER
Reinhard I-PER
( O
FDP B-ORG
) O
. O

Just O
because O
the O
bus O
is O
so O
rare O
, O
it O
is O
not O
a O
cheap O
means O
of O
transport O
and O
is O
therefore O
little O
used O
. O

This O
will O
change O
if O
the O
44er O
drives O
more O
frequently O
, O
speculated O
the O
free O
democrat O
. O

According O
to O
a O
magistrate O
report O
, O
this O
has O
been O
confirmed O
everywhere O
where O
the O
bus O
is O
easy O
to O
reach O
by O
subway O
, O
says O
Reinhard B-PER
. O

The O
second O
part O
of O
the O
SPD B-MISC
request I-MISC
required O
to O
connect O
the O
departure O
times O
of O
the O
bus O
at O
the O
station O
Gwinnerstraße B-LOC
in O
the O
Borsigallee B-LOC
with O
the O
subway O
of O
the O
line O
7 O
. O

Instead O
of O
every O

one O
, O
the O
FVV B-MISC

will O
then O
switch O
from O

second O

called O
a O
Fechenheimer B-MISC

her O

, O
which O
she O
had O
organized O
together O
with O
the O

on O
the O
" O
Burglehen B-LOC
" O
- O
in O
the O
district O
known O
as O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
. O

Objective O
of O
the O
action O
: O

The O
adults O
wanted O
to O
show O
that O
their O
older O
offspring O
on O
the O
playground O
there O
lack O
equipment O
to O
play O
. O

The O
place O
had O
been O
established O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

Another O
drawback O
: O

The O
place O
is O
often O
driven O
by O
cars O
that O
have O
nothing O
to O
look O
for O
there O
. O

Because O
the O
" O
Burglehen O
" O
, O
a O
large O
, O
with O
square O
stones O
paved O
place O
in O
the O
Fechenheimer B-MISC
village O
center O
, O
is O
pedestrian O
zone O
. O

Actually O
, O
only O
some O
residents O
with O
appropriate O
ID O
cards O
should O
drive O
over O
the O
" O
Linneplatz B-LOC
" O
, O
between O
5 O
and O
11 O
o'clock O
are O
also O
approved O
suppliers O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
, O
the O
parents O
wanted O
to O
block O
the O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
, O
from O
which O
the O
square O
can O
be O
reached O

However O
, O
since O
the O
action O
was O
supported O
by O
two O
honorary O
staff O
, O
the O
initiative O
had O
to O
abandon O
this O
project O
. O

For O
the O
staff O
of O
an O
authority O
is O
expressly O
forbidden O
to O
participate O
in O
such O
- O
soberly O
considered O
- O
illegal O
acts O
. O

But O
the O
parents O
did O
not O
want O
to O
give O
up O
the O
help O
of O
the O
two O
educators O
and O
the O
playground O
equipment O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
. O

After O
all O
, O
the O
game O
week O
had O
gone O
well O
without O
street O
blockade O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
, O
mother O
of O
five O
children O
. O

On O
the O
first O
two O
days O
about O
30 O
children O
had O
been O
there O
, O
painted O
and O
murmured O
in O
the O
self O
- O
built O

" O

Everything O
that O
moves O
in O

" O
, O
drew O
the O
little O
ones O
on O
two O
solar O

, O
which O
still O
have O
to O
be O
sewn O
together O
. O

Also O
a O
wall O
of O
the O
playground O
is O
still O
painted O
. O

On O
the O
third O
day O
of O
the O
game O
week O
the O
rain O
then O
temporarily O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
joyous O
hustle O
and O
bustle O
around O
the O
" O
Linnespielplatz B-LOC
" O
. O

Already O
about O
three O
years O
ago O
, O
the O
competent O
local O
council O
was O
working O
to O
block O
the O
" O
Burglehen B-LOC
" O
for O
the O
transit O
traffic O
and O
to O
establish O
a O
children O
's O
playground O
there O
. O

Last O
year O
a O
small O
playground O
was O
laid O
out O
in O
an O
angle O
in O
the O
front O
area O
of O
the O
square O
on O
Starkenburger B-LOC
Straße I-LOC
. O

Some O
sand O
, O
a O
few O
play O
equipment O
- O
for O
boys O
and O
girls O
who O
are O
no O
longer O
in O
toddler O
age O
, O
the O
offer O
is O
somewhat O
meager O
. O

This O
will O
be O
better O
in O
the O
future O
: O

The O
city O
youth O
wants O
to O
equip O
the O
" O
linne B-LOC
playground I-LOC
" O
additionally O
with O
balls O
, O
tires O
, O
stilts O
and O
other O
play O
equipment O
. O

The O
toys O
are O
to O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
lockable O
box O
and O
some O
keys O
are O
to O
be O
distributed O
to O
the O
parents O
. O

On O
the O
wooden O
playhouse O
, O
which O
the O
children O
wanted O
, O
the O
little O
ones O
will O
have O
to O
give O
up O
. O

The O
construction O
of O
such O
a O
hut O
is O
too O
complex O
and O
also O
linked O
with O
numerous O
safety O
requirements O
, O
said O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
. O

Replacement O
offered O
during O
the O
play O
week O
a O
wooden O
climbing O
frame O
of O
the O
children O
's O
office O
. O

A O
major O
disadvantage O
of O
the O
playground O
remains O
: O

He O
is O
simply O
too O
small O
to O
accommodate O
all O
the O
children O
who O
want O
to O
play O
there O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
offspring O
has O
already O
taken O
possession O
of O
a O
part O
of O
Linneplatz B-LOC
. O

There O
, O
however O
, O
the O
children O
do O
not O
play O
undisturbed O
. O

For O
, O
as O
Gabi B-PER
Daniel I-PER
reported O
, O
cars O
and O
trucks O
repeatedly O
lead O
illegally O

the O

, O
and O
sometimes O
" O

For O
a O

working O
through O
the O

to O
ensure O
that O

effectively O
banished O
from O

Their O
efforts O
have O
so O
far O
been O
unsuccessful O
, O
despite O
commitments O
by O

Proposal O

His O

applied O
a O

for O

about O
two O
years O

. O

However O
, O
the O
dispute O
over O
the O
building O
area O
in O
a O
preferred O
slope O
extends O
further O
back O
. O

A O
first O
plan O
of O
1983 O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
by O
the O
Magistrate O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
SPD B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
state O
government O
had O
criticised O
legal O
and O
formal O
errors O
of O
the O
development O
request O
. O

Basically O
, O
Greens B-ORG
and O
SPD B-ORG
refused O
to O
open O
up O
the O
grounds O
for O
a O
few O
" O
luxury O
houses O
" O
expensively O
. O

They O
wanted O
to O
preserve O
the O
" O

as O
part O
of O
a O
green O

between O
Seckbach B-LOC
, O
the O
nature O
reserve O
" O
Hungerbach B-LOC
" O
and O
the O
Berger B-LOC
slope I-LOC
. O

When O
the O
CDU B-ORG
then O
ruled O
in O
Wiesbaden B-LOC
, O
the O
magistrate O
presented O
a O
second O
plan O
, O
which O
was O
hardly O
different O
from O
the O
first O
. O

In O
1988 O
, O
before O
the O
state O
elections O
and O
the O
subsequent O
change O
of O
government O
, O
the O
Hessian B-MISC
Interior O
Minister O
blessed O
the O
development O
plan O
380 O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
there O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
built O
is O
due O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
to O
the O
complex O
conversion O
process O
for O
the O
area O
: O

The O
" O
stone B-LOC
" O
is O
composed O
of O
many O
small O
plots O
, O
which O
run O
as O
narrow O
stripes O
in O
north O
- O
south O
direction O
. O

An O
exception O
here O
makes O
the O
mentioned O
approximately O
1060 O
square O
meters O
large O
plot O
in O
the O
west O
of O
the O
area O
, O
on O
which O
is O
already O
a O
concrete O
foundation O
. O

The O
owners O
therefore O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
conversion O
, O
but O
could O
already O
start O
the O
construction O

Right O
at O
the O
beginning O
, O
the O
workers O
swirled O
up O
powerful O
dust O
there O
, O
which O
is O
why O
Klaus B-PER
Boller I-PER
was O
able O
to O
make O
a O
construction O
stop O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Already O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
July O
he O
had O
filed O
an O
objection O
against O
the O
building O

, O
after O
he O
had O
seen O
these O
several O
days O
before O
. O

Several O
so O

called O

from O
the O
original O
plan O
had O
been O
noticed O
by O
the O
tax O
specialist O
, O
who O
had O
been O
fighting O
against O
the O
cultivation O
of O
the O
feral O
orchard O
from O
the O
outset O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
requirement O
not O
to O
build O
terraced O
houses O
, O
the O
builders O
on O
the O
land O
in O
question O
may O
also O
deviate O
from O
the O
specified O
base O
area O
( O
GRZ O
) O
and O
the O
number O
of O
floors O
( O
GFZ O
) O
. O

These O
values O
indicate O
the O
ratio O
of O
the O
built O
- O
up O
floor O
area O
and O
the O
area O
of O
all O
rooms O
of O
a O
house O
to O
the O
square O
meter O
of O
the O
entire O
building O
plot O
. O

The O
approved O
base O
and O
floor O
area O
figures O
were O
increased O
by O
40 O
and O
44 O
percent O
respectively O
in O
the O
building O

compared O
to O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O

This O
means O
, O
to O

it O

that O
a O

Without O
the O

, O
only O
one O

" O

Basically O
, O
Kleinert B-PER
believes O
that O
Western O
party O

have O
produced O
an O
increasingly O
differentiated O
, O
highly O
complex O
network O
of O
institutions O
. O

In O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
actions O
, O
a O
multitude O
of O
different O
actors O
produce O
a O
growing O
immobility O
of O
the O
overall O
system O
. O
" O

You O
could O
say O
, O
disillusioningly O
: O

An O
increasing O
number O
of O
stakeholders O
are O
producing O
more O
and O
more O
noise O
at O
various O
levels O
of O
policy O
, O
administration O
and O
jurisdiction O
. O

Achieved O
in O
the O
matter O
is O
by O
the O
increasing O
volume O
relatively O
little O
. O

Because O
this O
is O
so O
, O
politics O
is O
increasingly O
escaping O
into O
symbolic O
actions O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
meets O
the O
laws O
of O
media O
democracy O
. O

The O
actions O
are O
replaced O
by O
the O
demonstration O
of O
thoughtfulness O
, O
the O
assurance O
that O
the O
problem O
is O
taken O
seriously O
, O
etc O
. O

Kleinert B-PER
also O
sees O
the O
development O
outlined O
by O
him O
as O
a O
downside O
to O
the O
democratisation O
spurt O
, O
which O
for O
more O
than O
20 O
years O
has O
produced O
a O
considerable O
gain O
in O
individual O
freedom O
of O
choice O
. O

Policymakers O
had O
a O
harder O
time O
legitimising O
themselves O
, O
less O
willing O
to O
accept O
, O
without O
question O
, O
decisions O
of O
superior O
bodies O
. O

The O
sense O
of O
" O
formalized O
social O
relations O
" O
, O
i.e. O
parties O
, O
trade O
unions O
or O
even O
associations O
, O
is O
also O
decreasing O
. O

According O
to O
Kleinert B-PER
, O
the O
weak O
design O
of O
politics O
is O
also O
the O
price O
that O
Western O
societies O
would O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
high O
level O
of O
pluralism O
of O
interests O
, O
views O
and O
lifestyles O
. O
" O

In O
essence O
, O
it O
is O
questionable O
whether O
the O
democratisation O
level O
of O
the O
1980s O
can O
be O
maintained O
under O
the O
difficult O
conditions O
of O
the O
1990s O
" O
, O
he O
says O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
lack O
of O
personalities O
that O
have O
impressed O
, O
too O
many O
politicians O
have O
acted O
interchangeably O
, O
" O
a O
little O
like O
politicians O
from O
the O
pole O
" O
, O
writes O
Kleinert B-PER
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
also O
a O
reflection O
of O
society O
, O
because O
such O
lawsuits O
exist O
in O
other O
professions O
, O
in O
sports O
, O
in O
art O
and O
in O
business O
. O
" O

Certainly O
" O
, O
Kleinert B-PER
said O
, O
" O
the O
leadership O
capacity O
of O
the O
political O
staff O
has O
decreased O
, O
while O
the O
vanity O
of O
the O
individual O
actors O
has O
increased O
. O
" O

With O
an O
increasing O
tendency O
, O
politicians O
tended O
to O
refer O
their O
judgments O
about O
themselves O
and O
their O
political O
performance O
solely O
from O
their O
reflection O
in O
the O

an O
aseptic O
note O
it O
is O
done O
to O
the O
German B-MISC
erotic O
photographers O
in O
the O
30s O
: O

The O
free O

offered O
here O
the O
casual O
occasion O
to O
produce O
as O
forced O
as O
possible O
, O
dignified O
body O
images O
. O

Up O
to O
the O
unscathed O
, O
more O
aggressive O
images O
of O
the O
current O
nude O
photography O
can O
nevertheless O
be O
determined O
some O
commonalities O
of O
this O
genre O
. O

Mostly O
the O
body O
is O
used O
as O
docile O
material O
, O
sometimes O
as O
an O
entire O
nude O
figure O
, O
sometimes O
as O
a O
fragmented O
body O
landscape O
. O

The O
lust O
of O
the O
portrayed O
plays O
almost O
no O
role O
- O
what O
these O
pictures O
repeatedly O
reveal O
, O
are O
rather O
the O
fantasies O
of O
the O
photo O
- O
formers O
, O
projected O
on O
the O
bodies O
of O
their O
choice O
. O

And O
that O
's O
not O
always O
very O
imaginative O
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
evident O
in O
the O
historical O
distance O
. O

The O
pornographic O
images O
from O
the O
early O
days O
of O
photography O
, O
around O
1850 O
, O
appear O
only O
as O
images O
of O
their O
taste O
, O
hardly O
as O
erotic O
photographs O
. O

In O
touching O
flopness O
the O
exposed O
models O
are O
photographed O
, O
whereby O
the O
long O
exposure O
times O
may O
have O
reinforced O
the O
somewhat O
wooden O
poses O
. O

The O
shameless O
and O
unrepentant O
voyeurism O
experience O
of O
the O
viewer O
is O
the O
real O
goal O
of O
these O
images O
- O
their O
design O
secondary O
. O

The O
lust O
had O
already O
disappeared O
from O
the O
picture O
at O
that O
time O
. O

The O
partly O
drastic O
stagings O
of O
newer O
date O
mostly O
aim O
at O
the O
same O
, O
old O
effects O
. O

Since O
it O
is O
relaxing O
to O
also O
see O
alternatives O
to O
these O
spread O
beauties O
. O

Far O
from O
common O
ideals O
, O
for O
example O
, O
stands O
a O
chest O
image O
of O
Gundula B-PER
Schulze I-PER
. O

An O
old O
lady O
, O
frenzy O
, O
a O
little O
uncertain O
, O
but O
very O
serious O
in O
the O
camera O
flashing O
. O

The O
direct O
view O
from O
the O
picture O
makes O
us O
frighten O
, O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
voyeur O
present O
. O

And O
so O
the O
woman O
appears O
as O
a O
dignified O
portrait O
, O
as O
a O
character O
study O
, O
not O
a O
pleasure O
object O
. O

Similar O
to O
the O
old O
couple O
that O
the O
Swede B-MISC
Jan B-PER
Bengtsson I-PER
held O
in O
tender O
embrace O
. O

Scheidt B-PER
writes O
in O
the O
preface O
of O
the O
accompanying O
catalogue O
that O
he O
has O
put O
together O
" O
a O
purely O
subjective O
selection O
" O
. O

He O
fortunately O
does O
not O
make O
noble O
art O
claims O

Equally O

the O

should O
also O

the O

" O
We O
have O
to O

more O

because O

only O

In O
1982 O
, O
parents O
of O
children O
with O

had O
decided O
to O
do O
something O
about O
the O
miserable O
conditions O
at O
the O

ward O
of O
the O

Too O
small O
spaces O
and O
unsatisfactory O
care O
of O
children O
and O
parents O
were O
the O
main O
criticisms O

Although O
there O
are O
still O
only O
two O
toilets O
and O
two O
showers O
for O
children O

But O
the O
situation O
at O
the O

improved O
considerably O

The O

From O

Back O

Artichoke B-LOC

In O
1789 O
, O
the O
Dribbdebächer O
had O
a O
column O
with O

construction O
built O
instead O
of O
the O
medieval O

The O
stone O
was O
decorated O
on O
four O
sides O

a O
wreath O
, O
which O
, O
as O
Helga B-PER
Heil I-PER
writes O
in O
her O
book O
about O
the O
Sachsenhäuser B-MISC

, O
which O
bore O
" O
names O
of O
the O
Brunnenschultheissen O

the O

master O

the O
stonemason O

Finally O
, O
a O
vase O
that O
resembles O
an O
artichoke O
rises O
above O
the O
crimped O

as O
a O
decoration O

This O

repeats O
itself O
again O
in O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
vase O

Renovated O
in O

, O
the O

The O

want O
to O
make O
a O
little O
advertising O
for O
the O

- O
but O
also O
to O
get O
to O

each O

the O

In O
the O

the O

in O

Since O

The O

Before O

The O

only O
a O

Every O

" O
said O
local O

Freya B-PER
Linder I-PER
of O

And O
with O
good O
reason O
: O

Even O
when O
it O
was O
about O
the O

the O

not O

for O
such O
a O
arc O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
accused O
themselves O
of O
not O
wanting O
to O
explain O
neutrally O

manipulate O
the O

remained O
loyal O
to O
fellow O

and O
club O

although O
he O
is O

clearly O

Although O
new O

were O
committed O
, O
the O
vein O

was O
too O
large O
to O
make O
hopes O
of O

Cucak B-PER
: O

" O
There O
are O
numerous O
talented O
players O
who O
have O
come O
here O
from O
the O
war O
zones O
, O
but O
they O
get O
no O
work O
permit O
and O
are O
therefore O
not O
allowed O
to O
play O
. O
" O

Nevertheless O
, O
he O
hopes O
that O
the O
team O
will O
make O
a O
good O
start O
to O
the O
season O
according O
to O
the O
motto O
" O
Now O
even O
more O
" O
. O
" O

Twenty O
years O
ago O
, O
Cucak B-PER
and O
four O
of O
his O
friends O
founded O
FC B-ORG
Tempo I-ORG
. O

The O
idea O
for O

club O
name O
, O
explains O
the O
according O
to O
his O
own O
words O
" O

besides O
his O
activity O
at O

whistles O
for O
several O
years O
point O
games O
- O
they O
came O
at O
that O
time O
, O
because O
the O
team O
had O
successfully O
steamed O
in O
rapid O
train O
speed O
through O
the O
preparatory O
games O
. O

And O
to O
this O
day O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
150 O
members O
believe O
that O
a O
national O
club O
designation O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
as O
the O
Croatian B-MISC
league O
competitor O
Dubrovnik B-ORG
or O
the O
AC B-ORG
Mladost I-ORG
( O
formerly O
Jugo B-ORG
Bornheim I-ORG
) O
have O
done O
. O

This O
changes O
, O
and O
Cucak B-PER
is O
particularly O
sad O
about O
it O
, O
nothing O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
sponsors O
have O
withdrawn O
, O
( O
the O
promised O
promotion O
premium O
could O
therefore O
not O
be O
paid O
) O
, O
the O
club O
was O
unloaded O
by O
tournaments O
and O
the O
four O
youth O
teams O
as O
well O
as O
the O
departments O
, O
table O
tennis O
, O
chess O
, O
bowling O
and O
folklore O
had O
to O
be O
dissolved O
. O

The O
chairman O
therefore O
looks O
forward O
to O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
20th O
anniversary O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
association O
planned O
in O
October O
. O
" O

We O
truly O
do O
not O
have O
many O
reasons O
to O
celebrate O
. O
" O

Since O
it O
is O
already O
a O
great O
pleasure O
that O
the O
players O
can O
continue O
to O
use O
the O
place O
of O
Germania B-ORG
Ginnheim I-ORG
, O
both O
for O
the O
twice O
weekly O
training O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O

However O
, O
there O
is O
neither O
an O
intact O
floodlight O
system O
( O
the O
city O
has O
not O
fulfilled O
its O
promises O
, O
so O
Cucak B-PER
) O
, O
nor O
a O
club O
home O
for O
the O
FC B-ORG
; O
after O
the O
games O
the O
kickers O
meet O
privately O
. O

Efforts O
to O
find O
a O
place O
of O
their O
own O
have O
so O
far O
failed O
: O

a O
problem O
that O
affects O
many O
clubs O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC

Therefore O
, O
a O
merger O
with O
the O
Kultur- O

Kunstverein O
" O

" O
is O
planned O

" O
It O
's O
difficult O
to O
lead O
this O
club O
, O
right O
now O
, O
where O
the O
resentments O
come O
out O
openly O
and O
sometimes O
we O
were O
already O
thinking O
about O

" O
but O
then O
we O
got O
together O

thought O
of O

It O
can O
only O
get O
better O

that O

The O
organization O
has O
worked O
better O
this O

, O
he O
explains O

The O
reason O
for O
this O
was O
that O
the O
agreement O

had O
been O
better O
than O
usual O

In O
particular O
, O
Fraund B-PER
emphasized O
the O
commitment O
of O

in O

" O

When O
I O
see O
how O
they O
are O
working O
here O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
understand O
that O
many O
people O
talk O
abhorrently O
about O
youth O

Especially O
the O
boys O
and O
girls O
of O
the O
Faustball O
department O
would O
have O
helped O
intensively O
in O
the O
setup O
and O
dismantling O
of O
the O
gymnastics O
equipment O
, O
he O
said O
. O

A O
total O
of O
200 O
youths O
train O
actively O
in O
the O
club O
; O
besides O
Faustball O
( O
the O

More O

more O

The O
number O

thus O
almost O
doubled O
in O

The O
only O
problem O

lack O

And O
so O
today O
the O

has O
a O
different O

, O
explained O
the O

. O

In O
his O
experience O
, O
the O
Rosists O
are O
more O
outwardly O
oriented O
than O
before O

" O

We O

" O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
the O

are O
always O
open O
for O

even O
for O

If O
you O

The O

The O

" O

the O
Finkenhofstraße B-LOC

the O
Fichardstraße B-LOC

Diagonal O

make O
the O

impossible O
. O

Shortly O
after O
the O

, O
the O
competent O

reacted O
: O

The O
Finkenhofstraße B-LOC

now O
too O
. O

But O
a O
resident O
of O
Lersnerstraße B-LOC
already O
drew O
attention O
to O
the O
next O
neuralgic O
point O
: O

Already O
now O
, O
numerous O

would O
choose O
the O
next O

out O

If O

, O
the O

: O

Also O
the O
Lersnerstraße B-LOC

the O

It O

all O

But O
even O
the O
best O
education O
and O
the O
greatest O
experience O
sometimes O
does O
not O
benefit O
much O
, O
because O
the O
animals O
are O
subject O
to O
variations O
in O
performance O
like O
humans O
. O
" O

Especially O
during O
the O
current O

with O

the O

sometimes O
completely O
of O

Some O

would O
have O
shown O
much O
better O
performance O
in O

preliminary O
decisions O
. O

For O
dogs O
such O
a O
competition O
also O
brings O
much O
unknown O
with O
it O
, O
because O
the O
shepherd O
and O
his O
dogs O
do O
not O
know O
the O
herd O
. O

It O
can O
happen O
that O
the O
herd O
gets O
nervous O
and O
suddenly O
drives O
the O
dogs O
. O

This O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
, O
but O
also O
considerable O
achievements O
were O
demanded O
by O
the O
shepherds O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
a O
herd O
of O
about O
320 O
sheep O
, O
as O
in O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
, O
runs O
on O
a O
road O
just O
over O
three O
meters O
wide O
, O
it O
pulls O
itself O
apart O
on O
a O
strekke O
of O
over O
300 O
meters O
and O
must O
be O
kept O
together O
. O

In O
Kirch B-LOC
- I-LOC
Göns I-LOC
the O
shepherds O
cursed O
over O
the O
strongly O
fallen O
prices O
that O
would O
drive O

Without O

EC B-ORG

many O
shepherds O
would O
be O
bankrupt O
according O
to O
his O
statements O

Therefore O

a O

today O
must O
have O
at O

one O

500 O

where O

areas O

However O
, O
this O
is O
not O
possible O
in O

because O

In O
the O
mid O

the O
then O

waived O
the O

rights O

the O

which O

The O

: O

The O

the O

Sylvia B-PER

reported O
on O

reactions O
of O
Frankfurt B-MISC

to O
the O

by O

that O

from O
the O
President O
of O
the O
Government O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
play O
operation O
in O
some O

. O

These O
exceptions O
are O
to O
apply O
only O
to O
point O
games O
or O
important O

. O
" O

The O
phone O
was O
not O
standing O
still O
. O

And O
our O
concern O
is O
met O
with O
great O
opposition O
among O
the O
population O
, O
" O
said O
the O
City O
Councillor O
. O

According O
to O
their O
words O
also O
the O
clubs O
have O
to O
expect O
to O
get O
along O
largely O
without O
water O
. O

For O
sports O
such O
as O
hockey O
, O
which O
is O
played O
in O
Frankfurt B-LOC
almost O
exclusively O
on O
artificial O
turf O
( O
which O
must O
be O
damp O
due O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
injury O
) O
, O
the O
water O
emergency O
without O
exception O
means O
the O
exit O
. O

Similarly O
it O
is O
about O
the O
tennis O
courts O
, O
which O
also O
have O
to O
be O
sprinkled O
with O
the O
valuable O
wet O
to O
be O
playable O
. O

Not O
quite O
as O
hard O
the O
footballers O
will O
be O
affected O
. O

Hard O
places O
should O
be O
humidified O
every O
now O
and O
then O
, O
otherwise O
the O
dust O
is O
too O
large O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
lawns O
can O
even O
burn O
without O
water O
at O
high O
heat O
. O

The O
associations O
discussed O
solutions O
with O
the O
representatives O
of O
the O
sports B-ORG
and I-ORG
bathing I-ORG
authorities I-ORG
. O

It O
was O
about O
ways O
to O
save O
water O
by O
taking O
short O
showers O
or O
collecting O
rainwater O
in O
containers O
. O

Another O
suggestion O
was O
to O
use O
the O
water O
used O
by O
the O
volunteers B-ORG
to O
bring O
them O
to O
the O
sports O

( O

the O

, O
however O
: O

Industrial O
water O
may O
not O
enter O
the O

" O
) O
. O

But O
also O
the O
concerns O
of O
the O
associations O
, O
which O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
water O
, O
listened O
to O
the O
department O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
topic O
of O
new O
electricity O
tariffs O
, O
which O
no O
longer O
take O
into O
account O
a O
basic O
fee O
. O

This O
fee O
had O
so O
far O
paid O
the O
city O
to O
relieve O
the O

. O

Sylvia B-PER

was O
able O

At O

about O
the O

negotiations O
with O

in O
order O
to O

for O

Sylvia B-PER
Schenk I-PER
said O
support O
for O
this O
case O
. O

Finally O
, O
a O
representative O
of O
the O
Griesheim B-ORG
sports I-ORG
community I-ORG
addressed O
an O
old O
problem O
. O

The O
sports O
fields O
and O
the O
functional O
buildings O
with O
showers O
and O
changing O
rooms O
are O
in O
poor O
condition O
( O
the O
district O
round O
view O
reported O
) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
SG B-MISC
representative I-MISC
got O
nothing O
new O
to O
hear O
. O

In O
the O
normal O
course O
of O
events O
, O
the O
renewal O
of O
the O
function O
house O
would O
begin O
and O
be O
completed O
in O
1993 O
, O
said O
Ms O
Schenk B-PER
. O

The O
funds O
for O
the O
artificial O
turf O
site O
are O
expected O
to O
be O
allocated O
for O
1994 O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
SG B-ORG
could O
play O
football O
again O
in O
the O
mid-1990s O
under O
normal O
conditions O
. O

The O
answer O
of O
the O
representative O
of O
the O

: O

If O
then O
there O
is O
still O
an O

The O

New O

turn O

" O
- O
a O
wisdom O
that O
is O
not O
always O
true O
. O

In O
relation O
to O
the O
renewal O
of O
heating O
systems O
, O
however O
, O
it O
certainly O
applies O
to O
: O

The O
past O
years O
have O
led O
to O
new O
insights O
and O
serious O
improvements O
in O
heating O
technology O
. O

If O
you O
are O
still O
using O
a O
heating O
system O
of O
the O
older O
year O
, O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
calculate O
by O
an O
expert O
how O
much O
energy O
and O
thus O
money O
you O
can O
save O
with O
a O
new O
, O
contemporary O
system O
. O

If O
the O
boiler O
is O
older O
than O
ten O
years O
, O
it O
is O
highly O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
have O
a O
saving O
potential O
of O
more O
than O
20 O
percent O
. O

If O
it O
is O
added O
that O
maintenance O
costs O
for O
a O
new O
plant O
generally O
fall O
significantly O
, O
the O
investment O
pays O
off O
within O
a O
few O
years O
. O

But O
there O
is O
another O
, O
valid O
argument O
: O

On O
30 O
September O
1993 O
the O
transitional O
period O
of O
the O
first O
Federal O
Immission O
Protection O
Regulation O

From O
that O

at O
the O

, O

must O
also O

Some O
people O
do O

like O
to O
hear O
it O
and O
feel O
it O
is O
discrimination O
, O
but O
it O
's O
like O
this O
: O

Books O
are O
disposable O
articles O
. O

Only O
a O
few O
copies O
are O
available O
to O
work O
beyond O
the O

Publishers O

dream O
of O

But O

I O

In O

that O
opens O
the O
way O
out O
of O
the O
dilemma O
: O

" O
Think O

the O

A O

( O
the O

came O
up O
with O
something O
. O

The O
idea O
was O
so O
brilliant O
that O

" O

A O
flash O
of O
mind O
that O
first O
arouses O
unbelieving O
astonishment O

the O

. O

The O
next O
reaction O
: O

There O

no O

at O

A O

is O
immersed O
in O
a O

of O

cake O
dough O
and O
then O
grilled O
over O

The O

At O
around O

the O
tribal O

Rainer B-PER
Seul I-PER
welcomed O
the O

He O
had O
made O
a O

over O
the O

to O
locate O
the O

About O
250 O

" O

This O
is O
somewhat O
outdated O
today O
, O
" O
says O
Sylvia B-PER
Wagner I-PER
contemplatively O
. O

For O
them O
, O
the O
function O
of O
the O
Scouts O
has O
changed O
: O

" O
We O
want O
to O
promote O
group O
life O
, O
practice O
solidarity O
and O
learn O
to O
develop O
understanding O
of O
each O
other O
's O
weaknesses O
. O
" O

The O
children O
should O
learn O
that O
" O
not O
everything O
goes O
after O
their O
booze O
" O
but O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
whole O
group O
must O
be O
taken O
into O
account O
. O

Today O
the O
tribe O
of O
St. B-ORG

seven O
honorary O

a O

between O

none O

the O

St. B-ORG
Bonifatius I-ORG
- O
there O
is O
no O
group O
leader O
missing O
. O
" O

No O
leaders O
" O
is O
anyway O
the O
main O
problem O
of O
the O
tribe O
, O
because O
not O
all O
interested O
children O
could O
be O
included O
in O
the O
groups O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lively O
tribal O
life O
: O

The O
scouts O
even O
have O
their O
own O
garden O
at O
Sachsenhäuser B-LOC
Landwehrweg I-LOC
, O
where O
the O
children O
have O
built O
a O
hut O
and O
where O
they O
can O
grill O
. O

On O
the O
regular O
group O
evenings O
in O
the O
community O
rooms O
the O
children O
consider O
their O
own O
program O
, O
the O
leaders O
should O
only O
support O
them O
. O

The O
highlight O
of O
every O
Scout O
year O
is O
the O
summer O
camp O
: O

This O
year O
, O
the O
umbrella O
association O
of O
the O
Scouts O
of O

come O
up O

something O
special O

As O

wild O
summer O
" O
several O
base O
camps O
had O
been O
set O
up O
, O
each O
meeting O
several O
tribes O
. O

This O
form O
has O
therefore O
been O
chosen O
so O
that O
the O
individual O
tribes O
can O
also O
get O
to O
know O
each O

once O
, O

says O
Bultmann B-PER

: O

I O

then O
that O

" O

According O
to O
Bultmann B-PER
, O
the O
company O
should O
clarify O
in O
its O
advertising O
that O
an O
" O
order O
to O
view O
" O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
the O

also O
push O
the O

Therefore O
, O
Bultmann B-PER
intends O
to O
examine O
whether O
the O

can O
be O
admonished O
for O
breach O
of O
paragraph O

of O

If O
the O

does O
not O
react O
, O
the O
Consumer O
Protection O
Association O
can O
also O
bring O
actions O
against O

Could O
the O

" O

At O

that O

The O

a O
completely O

this O

came O
surprisingly O
with O
the O

The O
disaster O
was O
looming O
as O
the O
seven O
- O
metre O

long O

slowly O
sluggished O
back O

One O
of O
the O
two O

reacted O
correctly O
: O

He O
jumped O
into O
the O
water O
to O
pull O
the O
raft O
with O
a O
rope O
to O
the O
shore O
about O
three O

Then O
the O

could O

come O
dry O

Whether O
the O
now O
panicked O

wanted O
to O
take O
their O
fate O
into O

, O
is O
unclear O

It O
is O
only O
certain O
that O
they O
jumped O
into O
the O
water O
about O
a O
meter O
deep O
and O
reached O
the O
saving O
shore O

The O
case O
might O
have O
been O

, O
according O
to O

enough O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O

not O
allowed O

The O

as O

as O
I O
remember O
, O
found O
pleasure O

Karlheinz B-PER

in O
the O
past O

so O
to O
speak O

Originally O
it O
may O
have O
been O
curiosity O
that O
drove O
the O
Frankfurter B-MISC
into O
the O
Old O

, O
when O
they O
heard O
that O
Stockhausen B-PER
- O
once O
denouncing O
as O
the O
Enfant O
terrible O
of O
modern O
music O
- O
will O
stand O
at O

will O
lead O
one O

his O

But O
at O
the O

after O

had O
become O
clear O
to O
many O
that O
here O
- O
with O

- O
is O
not O
a O

someone O

has O
something O

, O
this O

, O
in O
the O

, O
an O
opportunity O
to O
take O

into O

and O
becoming O

He O
explains O
his O

, O
explains O
, O
supported O

the O

, O
how O
his O
works O
are O
composed O
, O
how O

how O

The O
awareness O
that O

could O

" O
The O

Bernhard B-PER

showed O
relief O

Only O
one O
remained O
skeptical O
: O

Heinz B-PER
Löffler I-PER
, O
his O
sign O
Kerweborsch B-MISC
, O
presenter O
as O
well O
as O
" O
Kerwepfarrer B-MISC

In O

the O

finished O
at O

accompanied O

This O
too O
is O
no O

: O

There O

just O
no O
getting O
through O
the O

At O
the O
place O

, O
many O
parents O
and O
their O
children O
waited O
for O
the O
traditional O
spectacle O

Another O
positive O
observation O
: O

To O
the O

in O
the O
" O

village O
" O
came O
also O
many O
to O
the O

the O
surrounding O
area O
" O
emigrated O
Bernemer B-MISC
" O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
reunions O
were O
well O

What O
would O
be O
to O
consider O
for O
the O
future O
, O
the O
club O
ring O
chairman O
Ochs B-PER
formulated O
: O

" O
The O
train O
path O
could O
be O
shortened O
, O
roadways O
are O
deserted O
. O
" O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
Kerwegesellschaft O
was O
to O
organize O
a O
competition O
for O
better O
decoration O
, O
because O
with O
the O
festive O
decoration O
it O

not O
very O
well O
ordered O
. O

Even O
the O

he O
was O
also O
visited O
, O
could O
be O
characterized O
by O
the O
Kerwe O
society O
even O
more O
festive O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
responsible O
people O
should O
check O
whether O
the O
Kerwebaum B-MISC
can O
be O
brought O

The O

put O

A O
controversial O
" O
figure O
" O
of O
scientific O
life O
: O

structuralism O
, O
has O
become O
old O
. O

Historians O
and O
biographers O
swarm O
out O
and O
paint O
their O
gray O
in O
gray O
, O
with O
which O
, O
as O
Hegel B-PER
says O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
" O
rejuvenated O
" O
, O
but O
only O
something O
" O
recognize O
" O
. O

However O
, O
what O
is O
the O
best O
way O
of O
knowledge O
- O
the O
epopoe O
of O
structuralism O
or O
the O
history O
of O
structuralists O
. O

Mono- O
and O
biographical O
studies O
have O
now O
tracked O
the O
development O
of O
individual O
disciplines O
or O
the O
development O
of O
their O
most O
important O
thinkers O
. O

However O
, O
what O
has O
been O
lacking O
so O
far O
was O
a O
comprehensive O
history O
of O
this O
movement O
, O
which O
in O
France B-LOC
since O
the O
fifties O
has O
captured O
all O
human O
sciences O
and O
revolutionized O
methodically O
. O

However O
, O
such O
global O
access O
is O
subject O
to O
problems O
that O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
individual O
studies O
. O

Any O
uniform O
, O
continuous O
treatment O
of O
the O
so O
diverse O
phenomenon O
seems O
impossible O
, O
because O
structuralism O
was O
initially O
an O
epoch O
that O
, O
like O
any O
other O
, O
has O
hardly O
any O
precise O
limits O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
would O
be O
to O
consider O
whether O
one O
is O
not O
better O
from O
an O
anthropological O
, O
psychoanalytic O
, O
linguistic O
, O
historical O
etc O
. O

Structuralism O
speaks O
of O
structuralism O

What O
also O
connects O
such O
different O
personalities O
as O
Lévi B-PER

Strauss I-PER

Greimas B-PER
, O
Barthes B-PER

Althusser B-PER

Foucault B-PER

Derrida B-PER
, O
whose O
thinking O
also O
decays O
into O
different O
early O
and O
late O
phases O
? O

Were O
they O
even O
structuralists O
who O
had O
so O
clearly O
distanced O
themselves O
from O
this O
marking O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
the O
sixties O
? O

In O
his O
broad O
- O
based O
Histoire O
du O

, O
François B-PER
Dosse I-PER
has O
now O
renounced O
unity O

of O

from O
the O

It O
is O
not O

described O

but O
the O
genesis O
of O
the O
" O

The O
absence O

demanded O
its O
price O
: O

The O
two O
volumes O
, O
together O
a O
good O
1000 O
pages O
, O
offer O
less O
a O
history O
of O
structural O
thinking O
than O
an O
impressive O
panorama O
of O
French B-MISC
thinking O
from O
1945 O
to O
1990 O
. O
Short O
chapters O

are O

The O
difficult O

in O

a O

The O

to O
develop O
a O

concept O

he O
knew O

not O
write O

" O

Too O
much O
comes O
together O
here O
. O

Althusser B-PER
was O
apparently O
a O
man O
without O
qualities O
, O
but O
as O
a O
philosophy O
professor O
and O
as O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Communist O
Party O
he O
was O
able O
to O
rise O
to O
an O
intellectual O
myth O
. O

But O
he O
was O
also O
a O
mentally O
ill O
, O
whose O
life O
ended O
in O
a O
tragedy O
. O

His O
biographer O
sees O
his O
task O
in O
confronting O
this O
myth O
with O
the O
biographical O
reality O
to O
destroy O
it O
. O

By O
means O
of O
more O
diverse O
, O
new O
sources O
he O
carefully O
tries O
to O
penetrate O
into O
the O
imaginary O
world O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
strangled O
his O
wife O
. O

On O
500 O
pages O
he O
penetrates O
that O
time O
in O
which O
Althusser B-PER
was O
still O
completely O
unknown O
and O
in O
which O
the O
key O
to O
understanding O
the O
mystery O
must O
lie O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Algerian B-MISC
childhood O
, O
which O
has O
been O
thoroughly O
poisoned O
by O
a O
mother O
hostile O
to O
the O
body O

Before O

published O
a O

Because O

after O
about O
30 O

, O
the O

May O

This O
long O

term O

is O
currently O
being O
discussed O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
after O
an O
expert O
group O
of O
the O
" O
Association B-ORG

" O
( O
Newborn O

concluded O
in O
an O
opinion O
that O
" O
active O
life O
ending O
" O
could O
be O
acceptable O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
. O

A O
pediatrician O
, O
explained O
the O
president O

group O
, O
Cornelius B-PER
Versluys I-PER
, O
who O
ended O

acted O

natural O

and O
not O

report O
the O

This O
may O
be O
legally O
reprehensible O
, O
but O
from O
a O
moral O
point O
of O
view O
it O
may O
be O
responsible O
in O
some O
cases O
. O

According O
to O
communications O
from O
Versluys B-PER
, O
pediatricians O
are O
divided O
on O
the O
question O
whether O
the O
killing O
of O
a O
very O
severely O
damaged O
newborn O
is O
permitted O
. O

In O
the O
report O
" O
Do B-MISC

? O
" O

Therefore O
, O
recommendations O
would O
be O
made O
on O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
differences O
of O
views O
. O

According O
to O
the O
group O
, O
about O
300 O
newborn O
children O
die O
every O
year O
in O
the O
Netherlands B-LOC
because O
the O
doctor O
does O
not O
even O
start O
medical O
treatment O
or O
discontinues O
treatment O
. O

Versluys B-PER
estimates O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
of O
active O
life O
termination O
in O
newborns O
at O
a O
maximum O
of O
ten O
per O
year O
. O

The O
recommendations O
say O
that O
parents O
should O
be O
able O
to O
find O
help O
for O
their O
child O
with O
a O
doctor O
who O
understands O
their O
way O
of O
life O
. O

Doctors O
and O
parents O
should O
agree O
on O
what O
to O
do O
with O
the O
child O
. O

This O
could O
mean O
euthanasia O
in O
one O
case O
, O
but O
not O
in O
the O
other O
. O

If O
a O
doctor O
is O
not O
willing O
to O
end O
the O
child O
's O
life O
while O
the O
parents O
want O
it O
, O
he O
must O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
parents O
find O
the O
way O
to O
another O
doctor O
who O
fulfills O
their O
desire O
. O

The O
newborns O
to O
which O
the O
recommendations O
refer O
are O
babies O
who O
are O
not O
older O
than O
four O
weeks O
and O
need O
life O
- O
long O
care O
. O

These O
included O
, O
for O
example O
, O
children O
with O
an O
open O
back O
, O
with O
paralysis O
on O
the O
bladder O
, O
with O
severe O
brain O
damage O
, O
for O
which O
there O
is O
no O
prospect O
of O
a O
life O
with O
sufficient O
quality O
. O

Versluys B-PER
personally O
considers O
it O
acceptable O
to O
actively O
end O
the O
life O
of O
such O
babies O
if O
the O
parents O
also O
wanted O
it O
. O

The O
report O
of O
the O
group O
of O
specialists O
lays O
down O
criteria O
which O
are O
considered O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
life O
: O

Can O
the O
child O
think O
and O
communicate O
later O
on O
? O

Can O
it O
take O
some O
care O
of O
itself O
, O
can O
it O
be O
taken O
care O
of O
at O
home O
or O
is O
it O
life O
- O
long O
dependent O
on O
medical O
care O
? O

Is O
it O
going O
to O

And O
: O

How O
long O
will O
it O
live O
? O

Versluys B-PER
is O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
pediatrician O
, O
who O
has O
actively O
ended O
the O
life O
of O
a O
severely O
damaged O
baby O
, O
reporting O
it O
to O
the O
prosecutor O

However O
, O
it O
regrets O
that O
there O
are O
no O
legal O
rules O
governing O
the O
cases O
in O
which O
the O
judiciary O
regards O
and O
accepts O
active O
ending O
of O
life O
as O
an O
emergency O
. O

The O
working O
group O
finds O
that O
under O
the O
circumstances O
the O
doctor O
himself O
must O
weigh O
whether O
he O
considers O
it O
appropriate O
to O
inform O
the O
prosecutor O
of O
his O
actions O
or O
not O
. O

A O
judicial O
investigation O
, O
it O
is O
said O
, O
could O
cause O
great O
anxiety O

the O

pressure O

of O
the O
defenceless O
, O
i.e. O
women O
, O
children O
, O
old O
people O
, O
wounded O
. O

There O
is O
no O
point O
in O
bringing O
food O
to O
these O
people O
, O
then O
leaving O
them O
in O
the O
hail O
of O
the O
shells O
, O
while O
you O
drive O
yourself O
back O
to O
the O
safe O
shelter O
. O

How O
is O
such O
an O
action O
to O
be O
carried O
out O
? O

An O
aid O
convoy O
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
approaching O
the O
city O
of O
Gorazde B-LOC
, O
while O
it O
is O
exposed O
to O
a O
fierce O
artillery O
fire O
. O

Should O
the O
besiegers O
stop O
the O
fire O
until O
the O
food O
is O
delivered O
, O
or O
should O
the O
convoy O
wait O
until O
the O
fire O
ends O
at O
some O
point O
? O

Both O
seem O
unrealistic O
. O

There O
is O
therefore O
only O
one O
way O
to O
provide O
humanitarian O
assistance O
. O

All O
incapacitated O
persons O
must O
be O
granted O
free O
deduction O
to O
a O
safe O
place O
. O

Everything O
else O
is O
no O
help O
. O

Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
question O
arises O
whether O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
want O
the O
free O
withdrawal O
of O
women O
and O
children O
at O
all O
. O

They O
may O
reject O
it O
because O
it O
could O
see O
a O
renunciation O
of O
the O
land O
they O
claimed O
. O

It O
would O
be O
grateful O
if O
you O
would O
report O
on O
it O
. O

The O
Bosnians B-MISC
will O
also O
ask O
who O
feeds O
the O
soldiers O
when O
the O
women O
and O
children O
are O
no O
longer O
there O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
humanitarian O
aid O
at O
all O
for O
civilians O
only O
. O

The O
soldiers O
will O
always O
make O
sure O
that O
there O
is O
something O
left O
for O
them O
, O
probably O
even O
the O
greater O

The O
supply O
of O
food O
thus O
constitutes O
support O
for O
a O
warring O
party O
. O

It O
is O
hardly O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
will O
accept O
this O

We O
can O
only O
help O
the O
Bosnians B-MISC
by O
proposing O
a O
treaty O
to O
both O
them O
and O
the O
Serbs B-MISC
so O
that O
civilians O
in O
the O
contested O
areas O
are O
granted O
free O
and O
safe O
withdrawal O
to O
a O
safe O
place O
. O

There O
are O
no O
other O
options O
. O

Interference O
in O
the O
military O
conflict O
would O
be O
irresponsible O
. O

India B-LOC
, O
China B-LOC
, O
Romania B-LOC
, O
Zimbabwe B-LOC
take O
more O
or O
less O
open O
to O
the O
Serb B-MISC

Probably O
there O
are O
other O
allies O
. O

A O
confrontation O
with O
these O
states O
would O
lead O
to O
unforeseeable O
consequences O
. O

And O
these O
allies O
are O
also O
right O
. O

There O
is O
only O
about O
in O
the O
world O
. O

200 O
states O
, O
but O
more O
than O
1000 O
groups O
with O
their O
own O
language O
, O
culture O
or O
religion O
. O

The O
world O
would O
sink O
into O
chaos O
if O
all O
these O
minorities O
demanded O
their O
own O
state O
. O

Our O
position O
must O
be O
as O
follows O
: O

We O
help O
if O
all O
civilians O
in O
the O
contested O
areas O
are O
granted O
free O
withdrawal O
, O
and O
we O
can O
not O
help O
if O
these O
people O
are O
to O
stay O
there O
. O

Everything O
else O
must O
decide B-MISC
the O
Bosnians I-MISC

some O

Since O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
disruptive O
principle O
and O
the O
associated O
elimination O
of O
the O
principle O
of O
investigation O
( O
the O
question O
of O
guilt O
) O
, O
divorces O
have O
been O
comparable O
to O
decisions O
by O
a O
football O
arbitrator O
who O
has O
not O
seen O
the O
game O
, O
but O
has O
nevertheless O
decided O
on O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
match O
. O

This O
will O
have O
the O
catastrophic O
consequences O
mentioned O
above O
, O
because O
anyone O
who O
is O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
is O
supposed O
to O
spend O
years O
or O
possibly O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
on O
the O
livelihood O
of O
an O
ex O
- O
partner O
or O
ex O
- O
partner O
, O
who O
is O
often O
freaking O
out O
. O

In O
order O
to O
relieve O
legislators O
and O
the O
family O
court O
of O
responsibility O
for O
these O
consequences O
, O
the O
mediators O
should O
now O
hold O
. O

But O
if O
before O
, O
even O
before O
a O
couple O
is O
looking O
for O
help O
with O
a O
mediator O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
children O
remain O
independent O
of O
the O
question O
of O
guilt O
with O
the O
mother O
and O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
( O
usually O
still O
the O
man O
who O
earns O
more O
or O
more O
alone O
) O
not O
only O
the O
natural O
child O
support O
, O
but O
also O
after O
- O
marital O
support O
to O
an O
exgattin O
possibly O
only O
on O
the O
ego O
trip O
to O
pay O
, O
then O
the O
use O
of O
mediators O
is O
just O
a O
transfer O
of O
responsibility O
from O
the O
family O
court O
to O
the O
mediator O
. O

The O
mediation O
then O
aims O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
chatting O
of O
the O
" O
economically O
stronger O
" O
to O
accept O
the O
often O
ruinous O
consequences O
of O
the O
divorce O
first O
without O
resistance O
and O
thus O
to O
accept O
the O
already O
predetermined O
decision O
on O
custody O
and O
maintenance O
payment O
" O
consensually O
" O
to O
the O
family O
court O
. O

But O
if O
a O
court O
decision O
is O
already O
established O
, O
then O
this O
is O
probably O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
farce O
and O
only O
comparable O
with O
the O
previously O
established O
" O
decisions O
" O
of O
the O
courts O
of O
the O

Why O
since O

legal O
magazine O
with O
the O
signifying O

" O
dispute O
" O
sees O
dangers O
in O
mediation O
, O
is O
incomprehensible O
, O
because O
even O
in O
mediation O
everything O
is O
obviously O
going O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
woman O
. O

It O
is O
also O
incomprehensible O
, O
as O
Mrs O
Häsing B-PER
- I-PER
Levend I-PER
can O
say O
in O
the O
light O
of O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
to O
bring O
into O
play O
the O
" O
power O
gap O
between O
men O
and O
women O
in O
our O
society O
" O
and O
to O
say O
that O
women O
come O
to O
the O
counselling O
centres O
with O
the O
worse O
cards O
and O
to O
the O
mediator O
's O
negotiating O
table O
. O

If O
( O
as O
she O
writes O
herself O
) O
it O
is O
clear O
before O
visiting O
a O
mediator O
, O
who O
the O
children O
stay O
with O
and O
who O
the O
ex O
- O
partner O
has O
to O
pay O
aftermarital O
support O
, O
then O
one O
knows O
in O
which O
direction O
the O
" O
power O
gap O
" O
is O
going O
in O
divorce O
. O

The O
dispute O
triggered O
by O
divorce O
, O
and O
especially O
the O
children O
, O
who O
are O
often O
burdensome O
for O

can O

The O

sometimes O
a O

one O

fought O

as O
the O

" O

When O

he O

Alimov B-PER
had O
learned O
about O
the O
International B-ORG

the O

But O
the O
53 O

year O
- O
old O
crane O
driver O
did O
not O
give O
up O
. O

He O
packed O
up O
his O

left O

began O
to O
drive O
off O
the O

on O
both O

" O

I O
learned O
a O

" O

There O
there O
were O
lists O

the O
injured O

" O

On O
my O

on O
the O

I O
counted O
a O
total O
of O
1700 O
soldiers O
and O
5000 O
civilians O
" O
, O
says O
Alimov B-PER

However O
, O
these O
were O
only O
the O
figures O
of O
the O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
who O
had O
fallen O
into O
Armenian B-MISC
captivity O

Thanks O
to O
his O
tenacity O
, O
Alimov B-PER
finally O
reached O
Kazakh O
in O
Azerbaijan B-MISC
's I-MISC
border O
town O
that O
his O
son O
was O
planned O
to O
be O
involved O
in O
a O
prisoner O
exchange O
. O
" O

Together O
with O
four O
Azerbaijanis B-MISC
and O
one O
woman O
he O
should O
be O
exchanged O
for O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
. O
" O

But O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

As O
Alimov B-PER
found O
out O
, O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
officer O
is O
with O
an O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
family O
who O
holds O
him O
captive O
to O
organize O
an O
exchange O
for O
his O
own O
son O
in O
Armenia B-LOC
. O

Since O
this O
in O
turn O
is O
held O
by O
an O
Armenian B-MISC
family O
, O
which O
thereby O
wants O
to O
free O
its O
own O
son O
from O
Azerbaijani B-MISC
captivity O
, O
the O
company O
failed O
. O

" O
Our O
governments O
are O
too O
young O
to O
have O
everything O
under O
control O
, O
" O
explains O
Vladimir B-PER
Airapetjan I-PER
, O
KGB B-MISC
chief I-MISC
in O
the O
Armenian B-MISC
border O
village O
of O
Idshewan B-LOC

Agreements O

the O

not O

" O

not O

at O

the O
Armenian B-MISC
Idevan B-LOC

Together O

She O
humbly O
holds O
the O

in O

her O

It O
's O
fun O
for O
her O

so O
disguised O
by O
the O

guided O
by O

Against O

, O
Mareike B-PER

Jessica B-PER
begin O
to O
study O
their O

" O

You O

warns O

Mareike B-PER
presses O

herself O

" O

Okay O

she O
says O

begins O
to O

Then O
it O

Angie B-PER

This O

, O
Mareike B-PER
tries O
to O

clear O
with O

lips O

Then O
she O
rips O
the O
wrong O
hair O
off O
her O
head O

Her O
blonde O
mane O
falls O
on O
the O

The O
two O

do O
n't O
really O
know O
how O
to O
interpret O
the O

. O

Jessica B-PER
dances O
with O
her O
fan O
more O
like O
a O
Spaniard B-LOC

The O
last O
bar O

faded O

Again O
Jessica B-PER
whipping O
up O
and O
down O
excitedly O
: O

" O
Can O
I O
go O
home O
now O
? O
" O

" O
I O

, O
Mareike B-PER

First O
of O

When O
Leningrad B-LOC
was O
baptised O
back O
to O
the O
old O
name O
of O
St. B-LOC
Petersburg I-LOC
, O
one O
wonders O
why O
not O
also O
the O
name O
Kirov B-LOC
due O
to O
the O
revolution O
of O
1917 O
was O
changed O
in O
Marinsky B-LOC
( O

Also O
musically O
, O
the O

seeks O
the O
compromise O
between O

positions O
and O
finds O
its O
own O
way O

Although O

as O

Emil B-PER

on O

But O
it O
does O
not O
follow O
in O

This O
had O
already O
been O
the O
case O
in O
Claudio B-PER
Abbado I-PER

Vienna B-MISC

recording O
( O

where O
the O

passed O
into O
Stravinsky B-PER

iridescent O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
conclusion O
of O
this O
ideologically O
open O
and O
in O
the O
best O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
epic O
work O
is O
delicate O
. O

Shostakovich B-PER
had O
tried O
to O
round O
out O
the O
traditional O
sketches O
by O
letting O
fire O
death O
follow O
the O

a O
harmonisation O

which O
certainly O
contradicts O
Musorgsky B-PER

historical O
image O

Gergiew B-PER
now O
takes O
a O
different O
path O
than O
Abbado B-PER

the O
final O

a O
convincing O
solution O
as O
in O
other O
detail O
problems O
. O

Also O
musically O
, O
Gergiew B-PER
goes O
his O
own O
way O
. O

He O
interprets O
the O
music O
unequally O
introverted O
than O
Abbado B-PER
( O
whose O
cuts O
he O
avoids O
) O
, O
bends O
the O
musical O
epic O
into O
a O
often O
chamber O
music O
style O
. O

He O
can O
afford O
to O
renounce O
any O
theatricalism O
because O
his O
choirs O
impress O
with O
a O
fantastic O
fine O
articulation O
. O

Also O
the O
soloist O
ensemble O
, O
renouncing O
every O
loaned O
star B-PER
, O
convinces O
by O
the O
fine O
cut O
of O
its O
access O
. O

The O
renunciation O
of O
spectacular O
effects O
can O
also O
be O
seen O
in O
the O
sound O
technique O
of O
the O

produced O
in O
the O
bitterest O
winter O

of O

Everything O

show O
us O
an O
evil O
story O
from O

This O

20 O
years O

, O
the O
Italian B-MISC
Salesian O
Father O
Xavier B-PER

Nicoló I-PER
had O
founded O
this O

the O

, O
who O
had O
taken O
care O

the O
last O

" O
The O
program O
aims O
firstly O
to O
humanize O
the O
problem O

and O
secondly O
to O
show O
those O
affected O
a O
comprehensive O
alternative O

life O
, O
" O
explains O

year O
- O
old O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
, O
a O
pedagogical O
assistant O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
and O
adds O
: O

" O
This O
should O
take O
into O
account O
the O
positive O
characteristics O
of O
the O
children O
, O
such O
as O
their O
ability O
to O
work O
together O
and O
their O
group O
solidarity O
that O
they O
have O
learned O
on O
the O
street O
. O
" O

Carlos B-PER
has O
lived O
through O
the O
four O
stages O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the O
last O
of O
which O
is O
the O
children O

republic O
, O
himself O
once O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
is O
called O
" O
friendship O
" O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
and O
his O
staff O
go O
to O
the O
children O
, O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
called O
" O
gamines O
" O
, O
on O
the O
street O
to O
make O
friends O
with O
them O
. O

So O
the O
program O
adapts O
to O
the O
world O
of O
street O
children O
and O
not O
vice O
versa O
. O

First O
they O
watch O
the O
children O
. O

After O
the O
first O
contacts O
they O
finally O
start O
playing O
with O
each O
other O
. O

For O
this O
, O
the O
educators O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
have O
learned O
their O
own O
language O
of O
" O
gamines O
" O
, O
which O
they O
speak O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
protect O
themselves O
better O
on O
the O
road O
against O
others O
. O

Afterwards O
they O
invite O
the O
children O
to O
a O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
, O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
children O
relax O

live O

a O

without O
drugs O

About O
90 O
percent O
of O
the O
approximately O
5000 O
street O
children O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
resort O
to O
drugs O
. O

Many O
sniff O
shoe O
glue O
, O
with O
which O
they O
numb O
their O
nerves O
and O
hunger O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
however O
, O
" O

is O
also O
taken O

particularly O
dangerous O

which O
is O

The O
trip O
to O
Arvelaez B-LOC
offers O
the O
staff O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
above O
all O
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
to O
know O
the O
background O
for O
the O
street O
life O
of O
the O
children O
. O

All O
project O
managers O
agree O
that O
- O
like O
many O
other O
problems O
in O
Colombia B-LOC
- O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
also O
have O
their O
main O
cause O
in O
the O
social O
distress O
of O
many O
families O
. O

According O
to O
the O
State O
Statistical B-ORG
Office I-ORG
of O
1990 O
, O
38 O
per O
cent O
of O
all O
Colombian B-MISC
households O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O

for O
their O

Many O
of O
these O
families O
have O
fled O
from O
the O
country O
to O
the O
city O

There O
, O
people O
are O
driven O
by O
a O
lack O
of O
training O
prospects O
and O
medical O
care O
in O
rural O
areas O

but O
also O
by O
the O
lack O
of O
their O
own O
land O
and O

from O
which O
they O
can O
live O
, O
and O
above O
all O
by O
the O
continuing O
" O

( O

, O
which O
still O
prevails O
there O
: O

Although O
the O
attacks O
of O
the O

after O
the O
cessation O
of O
the O
military O
arm O
of O
the O
Medellìn B-ORG

last O

have O
decreased O
, O
the O
aggressions O
between O
the O
military O

the O
rebels O
are O
now O
increasing O
again O
after O
unsuccessful O
negotiations O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O

. O

Many O
civilians O
are O
involved O
in O

In O
the O
city O
, O
however O
, O
refugees O
often O
do O
not O
find O
work O
or O
just O
work O
in O
the O
" O
informal O
sector O
" O
, O
so O
they O
are O
without O
regulated O
income O
. O

In O
Bogotá B-LOC
, O
more O
than O
440 O

workers O
, O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
the O

earn O
less O

which O
is O
already O
very O
low O
, O
according O
to O
the O
economic O
data O
of O
the O

Therefore O
, O
both O
parents O
often O
have O
to O
work O
. O

The O
children O
either O
stay O
alone O
at O
home O
or O
go O
to O
the O
street O
where O
they O
contribute O
to O
family O
income O
through O
casual O
work O
, O
begging O
or O
stealing O
. O

Often O
they O
then O
join O
the O
street O
children O
and O
break O
off O
contact O
with O
the O
family O
because O
they O
feel O
exploited O
there O
and O
are O
often O
also O
abused O

that O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
set O
up O
twelve O
years O
ago O
for O
the O
street O
boys O
. O

At O
the O
entrance O
gate O
of O
the O
yard O
, O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
give O
off O
their O
drugs O
and O
then O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
. O

You O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
wash O
yourself O
, O
to O
play O
football O
and O
, O
if O
necessary O
, O
to O
have O
yourself O

For O
eight O
days O
I O
've O
been O
in O
the O
patio O
, O
because O
here O
there O
's O
breakfast O
and O
lunch O
, O
" O
says O
13 O
- O
year O
- O
old O
Julian B-PER
. O

He O
also O
became O
street O
boy O
because O
he O
was O
beaten O
by O
his O
parents O
in O
the O
poor O
district O
" O
Santa B-LOC
Librada I-LOC
" O
in O
the O
south O
of O
Bogotá B-LOC
. O

But O
like O
many O
others O
it O
pulls O
Julian B-PER
back O
to O
the O
street O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

The O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
become O
accustomed O
to O
the O
" O
free O
life O
" O
there O
. O

This O
will O
of O
freedom O
is O
respected O
by O
the O
employees O
of O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
because O
in O
the O
open O
institution O
one O
wants O
to O
take O
the O
dignity O
of O
the O
children O
seriously O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
second O
stage O
of O
the O
programme O
- O
whose O
term O
" O
freedom O
" O
already O
indicates O
- O
children O
can O
leave O
again O
. O

But O
here O
they O
have O
to O
follow O
very O
specific O
rules O
, O
for O
example O
for O
eating O
and O
sleeping O
, O
and O
have O
discussions O
with O
those O
responsible O
. O

Like O
the O
employees O
of O
the O
project O
in O
the O
first O
approximation O
efforts O
with O
the O
children O
on O
the O
street O
, O
one O
tries O
here O
also O
first O
to O
return O
the O
children O
to O
their O
families O
. O

Because O
" O
the O
best O
institution O
is O
the O
true O
family O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
Lara I-PER
as O
well O
as O
Manuel B-PER
Ospina I-PER
is O
convinced O
of O
. O

However O
, O
they O
experience O
that O
the O
children O
usually O
return O
there O
only O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
then O
they O
come O
back O
to O
the O
" O
patio O
" O
. O

They O
start O
again O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
which O
those O
who O
have O
once O
retired O
must O
do O
for O
educational O
reasons O
. O
" O

As O
a O
rule O
, O
a O
child O
leaves O
the O
program O
three O
times O
, O
until O
he O
really O
knows O
this O
" O
, O
Carlos B-PER
points O
out O
once O
again O
that O
the O
" O
gamines O
" O
have O
learned O
to O
appreciate O
freedom O
on O
the O
street O
. O

In O
the O
third O
stage O
, O
which O
is O
called O
" O
Bosconia B-MISC
" O
, O
the O
children O
then O
draw O
but O
finally O
a O
conclusion O
under O
their O
past O
. O

As O
a O
symbolic O
gesture O
for O
this O
they O
solemnly O
burn O
their O
rag O
dresses O
. O

Father O
Nicoló B-PER
sees O
this O
stage O
as O
a O
playful O
introduction O
to O
the O
world O
of O
work O
. O

Now O
the O
children O
regularly O
go O
to O
school O
and O
learn O
handicraft O
activities O
in O
a O
workshop O
and O
in O
ceramic O
courses O
. O

When O
the O
caregivers O
finally O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
a O
child O
has O
matured O
, O
it O
changes O
to O
the O
children O
's O
republic O
" O
La B-LOC
Florida I-LOC
" O
, O
where O
currently O
355 O
teenagers O
live O
, O
study O
and O
work O
. O

while O
the O
houses O
of O
the O
first O
stages O
of O
the O
program O
of O
Father O
Nicoló B-PER
are O
located O
in O

where O
most O

Florida I-LOC
" O
is O
located O
in O
a O
quiet O
, O
green O
landscape O
outside O
the O
city O
. O
" O

Thus O
the O
environment O
contributes O
to O
the O
education O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
hectic O
life O
in O
the O
dirty O

, O
you O
can O
prepare O
yourself O
here O
in O

Flashback O
: O

On O
Friday O
, O
September O
5 O
, O
1986 O
, O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
breathed O
deep O
through O
in O
the O
Schloßberghalle B-LOC
Nidderau I-LOC
. O

They O
had O
been O
elected O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
Group I-MISC
in O
the O
leadership O
positions O
in O
the O
Landratsamt O
. O

The O
previous O
main O
officials O
of O
CDU B-ORG
and O

had O
to O
clear O
their O
armchairs O

Red B-MISC

dreams O
from O
then O
are O
now O
bursting O
. O

The O
last O
" O
great O
act O
" O
: O

After O
tough O
negotiations O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
was O
able O
to O
implement O
the O
1992/93 O
double O
budget O
with O
the O
help O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
last O
year O
. O

Then O
the O
SPD B-ORG
stumbled O
on O
the O
landfill O
question O
into O
a O
voting O
disaster O
in O
the O
Kreistag O
. O

Although O
not O
wanted O
, O
the O
NPD B-ORG
became O
courtable O
as O
a O
brown O
tinge O
at O
the O
scales O
at O
once O
. O

The O
sharper O
gait O
of O
Landrat O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
and O
his O
deputy O
Pipa B-PER
on O
the O
asylum O
issue O
documents O
that O
there O
is O
no O
consensus O
between O
the O
SPD B-ORG
and O
the O
Greens B-ORG
in O
the O
circle O
on O
this O
issue O
either O
. O

While O
the O
two O
main O
officials O
openly O
accuse O
the O
country O
of O
failure O
because O
of O
the O
conditions O
in O
the O
Gelnhäuser B-LOC
Coleman I-LOC

, O
which O
has O
been O

with O
asylum O

( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O
, O
the O
Greens B-ORG
find O
it O
" O
bad O
and O
reprehensible O
when O
asylum O
debates O
get O
a O
voice O
- O
catching O
character O
" O
. O

That O
buses O
with O
refugees O
are O
sent O
back O
from O
the O
Main B-LOC

Kinzig I-LOC
- O
Kreis O
is O
not O
an O
isolated O
case O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
1986 O
, O
Eyerkaufer B-PER
, O
then O
SPD B-MISC
leader I-MISC
in O
the O
Main O
- O
Kinzig B-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
, O
denounced O
that O
the O
CDU B-MISC
- I-MISC
led I-MISC
circle O
had O
refused O
to O
accept O
a O
group O
of O
asylum O
seekers O
. O

In O
a O
current O
hour O
this O
was O
called O
by O
eyerkaufer B-PER
as O
" O
no O
serious O
course O
of O
action O
" O
. O

The O
asylum O
seekers O
had O
" O
been O
found O
to O
be O
beach O
property O
at O
best O
" O
, O
the O
present O
Landrat O
explained O
at O
that O
time O
. O

If O
next O
Friday O
the O
SPD B-ORG
wants O
Erich B-PER
Pipa I-PER
to O
be O
named O
First O
District O
Representative O
again O
in O
that O
same O
Schloßberghalle B-LOC
, O
it O
needs O
besides O
its O
own O
, O
however O
, O
two O
additional O
votes O
from O
another O
camp O
. O

The O
Greens B-ORG
already O
let O
see O
through O
, O
Pipa B-PER
did O
not O
join O
in O
the O
secret O
vote O
. O

In O
the O
meantime O
, O
the O
CDU B-ORG
has O
opposed O
speculation O
that O
there O
would O
be O
" O
submarines O
" O
in O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
Union O
, O
which O
would O
have O
joined O
the O
First O
County O
Council O
. O

Pipa B-PER
wants O
to O
be O
elected O
" O
by O
no O
means O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
neo B-MISC
- I-MISC
Nazis I-MISC
" O
according O
to O
his O
own O
statements O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
however O
, O
it O
considers O
it O
necessary O
that O
the O
position O
of O
the O
First O
District O
Administrator O
should O
not O
remain O
vacant O
for O
months O
. O

Pipa B-PER
, O
the O
displeasured O
journalist O
with O
abstractions O
, O
appeals O
to O
the O
Kreistag O
members O
not O
to O
evade O
their O
responsibilities O
. O

So O
he O
already O
expressed O
publicly O
that O
" O
another O
circus O
director O
must O
approach O
if O
I O
am O
not O
re O
- O
elected O
at O
the O
end O
of O
August O
" O
. O

The O
position O
would O
then O
have O
to O
be O
advertised O
immediately O
and O
an O
election O
preparation O
committee O
would O
have O
to O
be O
established O
. O

On O
the O
subject O
of O
re O
- O
election O
, O
the O
five O
- O
member O
NPD B-MISC
- I-MISC
Riege I-MISC
is O
still O
covered O
and O
can O
not O
be O
looked O
into O

. O

However O
, O
the O
SPD B-ORG
has O
announced O
that O
the O
re O
- O
election O
application O
in O
the O
Kreistag O
will O
only O
be O
made O
if O
it O
is O
previously O
excluded O
that O
Pipa B-PER
can O
only O
remain O
in O
office O
with O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
NPD B-ORG
. O

In O
the O
Kreistag O
, O
however O
, O
not O
only O
the O
topic O
of O
re O
- O
election O
plays O
a O
role O
, O
it O
will O
soon O
also O
be O
about O
the O
election O
of O
the O
Green B-MISC
Decent I-MISC

Despite O
the O

of O

and O

mandate I-MISC
holders I-MISC
from O
Hanau B-LOC
, O

now O
finally O
put O
the O

in O
front O
of O
the O
door O
and O
decided O
on O
a O

( O
the O
FR B-ORG
reported O
) O

Even O
before O
the O
summer O
holidays O
, O
the O
district O
board O
of O
the O
Greens B-ORG
had O
declared O
that O
the O
SPD B-ORG
had O
to O

Friedrich B-PER
again O
as O

. O

At O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
legislative O

Friedrich B-PER
was O
even O
praised O
by O
the O
then O
Green B-MISC
spokesman I-MISC
Horst B-PER
Gunkel I-PER
as O
a O

. O

In O

with O

Although O

to O

the O

too O
eagerly O
into O

, O
Friedrich B-PER

for O

one O
of O

According O

this O

Morlock B-PER
's I-PER
thesis O
contradicts O
the O
BUND B-MISC
scientist I-MISC
Rolf B-PER
Neidhardt I-PER
decisively O

Dioxin O
exists O
in O
the O
ecosystem O
only O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
chlorine O
chemistry O
. O

No O
traces O
of O
dioxin O
have O
been O
discovered O
in O
crude O
oil O
, O
coal O
or O
even O
in O
mummified O
, O
centuries O
- O
old O
eskimo O
- O
bleaches O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
scientific O
studies O
in O
wood O
burnings O
would O
only O
have O
revealed O
high O
dioxin O
concentrations O
, O
for O
example O
, O
when O
PVC O
has O
been O
added O
. O

According O
to O
Neidhardt B-PER
, O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O
so O
dramatically O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
the O
Federal O
Government O
considers O
that O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
a O
public O
remedy O
and O
advocates O
the O
closure O
of O
unnecessary O
sources O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
BUND B-ORG
looks O
at O
the O
urban O
crematorium O
and O
opposes O
the O
cremation O
of O
people O
in O
whose O
adipose O
tissue O
dioxin O
is O
deposited O
concentrated O
. O

Although O
Gerhard B-PER
Morlock I-PER
does O
not O
disagree O
with O
the O
view O
that O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
in O
the O
environment O
has O
increased O

However O
, O
it O
considers O
the O
installation O
of O
an O
electric O
filter O
in O
the O
plant O
to O
be O
sufficient O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
limit O
value O
. O
" O

I O
think O
the O
little O
exhaust O
gas O
from O
the O
crematorium O
is O
irrelevant O
, O
" O
says O
Morlock B-PER
. O

As O
a O
potentially O
much O
larger O
source O
of O
load O
, O
he O
sees O
the O
" O
huge O
flue O
gas O
quantities O
of O
the O
Staudinger B-LOC
power O
plant O
" O
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
it O
should O
be O
measured O
there O
. O

Although O
the O
concentration O
of O
dioxins O
per O
cubic O
metre O
of O
exhaust O
air O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
measurable O
, O
the O
enormous O
amount O
of O
dioxins O
would O
add O
to O
the O
burden O
. O

" O

There O

For O
him O

this O

The O

It O

bid O
, O
Biwer B-PER
said O
that O

Medebach B-PER
: O

" O

" O

Medebach B-PER
also O

out O
that O

The O
administration O
itself O
had O
already O
set O
itself O
up O
to O
save O

before O
the O

. O
" O

We O

As O
the O
mayor O
describes O
, O
he O
has O
had O
many O
discussions O
with O

over O
the O
past O
weeks O
on O
the O
topic O
of O

: O

" O

Some O
have O

Especially O

reported O
Medebach B-PER

The O
Magistrate O

translated O
the O

into O
understandable O

and O
published O
it O
in O
the O

" O

The O

what O

are O
allowed O

Mayor O
Wilfried B-PER

In O
the O
case O
of O

collection O
facilities O
, O
the O
city O
grants O
exemption O
from O
the O
" O
congestion O
and O
use O
obligation O
" O
. O

This O
means O
an O
indirect O
subsidy O
, O
explains O
the O
mayor O
, O
because O
those O
affected O
then O
do O
not O
have O
to O

any O
canal O

for O
the O
domestic O
water O
. O

That O

In O
addition O
, O
Martin B-PER
is O
not O
quite O
enthusiastic O
about O
the O
emergency O
regulation O
. O

Since O
as O
reported O
lawns O
may O
not O
be O
blown O
up O
, O
he O
fears O
great O
damage O
to O
the O

Therefore O
, O
he O
requested O
a O
derogation O
from O
the O
President O
of O

. O

The O
sports O
facilities O
are O
now O
designed O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
played O
even O
after O

, O
and O
well O
drained O
. O

They O
dry O
out O
very O
quickly O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
regularly O
rained O
, O
gives O
Martin B-PER
to O
consider O
. O

Therefore O
, O
if O
the O
sports O

were O
not O
blown O
up O
, O
damage O

the O

of O
about O
50 O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O

has O
come O
to O
the O
aid O
of O
the O

However O
, O
the O
dry O
matter O
should O
lead O
to O
a O
fundamental O
debate O
on O
the O
installation O
of O

Landrat O
Rolf B-PER
Gnadl I-PER
( O

has O
already O
opened O
the O

about O

For O
Niddatal B-LOC
, O
the O
mayor O
does O
not O
consider O
the O
water O
problem O
as O
dramatic O
as O
in O
the O
metropolitan O
area O

Due O
to O
increased O
environmental O

the O

you O

almost O

What O
political O
perspective O
do O
you O
have O
to O

these O

? O

Steiner B-PER

We O
are O
fully O
aware O
that O
the O
Palestinians B-MISC
will O
accept O
nothing O
other O
than O
the O
full O
political O
autonomy O
that O
ultimately O
leads O

a O
Palestinian B-LOC

If O
Mr O

to O

here O
that O
the O
death O

many O

him O

that O

us O

As O

But O
they O

The O

" O
When O

" O
that O

the O

would O
not O
always O

But O
maybe O
it O
is O
also O
what O
constitutes O
the O
art O
of O
the O
Makonde B-MISC

Most O
sculptures O
produce O
the O
macond B-MISC
in O
a O
state O

fear O

Fear O
is O
the O
constant O
companion O
of O
this O
people O

who O
according O
to O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
lives O
in O

completely O
different O

unimaginable O

For O
her O
, O
a O
dream O
is O
reality O

which O
is O
represented O

: O

" O
When O
the O
macondes B-MISC
dream O
that O
their O

angry O
at O

because O
no O
one O

they O
get O
up O

morning O

begin O
to O
carve O
the O
contours O

the O
great O
- O
grandmother O
" O
. O

Her O
guilty O
conscience O
is O
so O
often O
the O
starting O
point O
of O
the O
work O
. O

The O
Makonde B-MISC
also O
feel O
constantly O
surrounded O
by O
demons O
, O
in O
the O
Swahili B-MISC
language I-MISC
" O
Shetani O
" O

Of O
the O
" O
Shetani O
" O
there O
is O

They O
are O
mostly O
mixed O

of O

animal O
, O
which O
are O
ferocious O

rogue O
drift O

But O
not O
all O
spirits O
think O
the O
Makonde B-MISC
are O
dangerous O

" O
The O
good O
spirits O
can O
be O
recognized O
by O
the O
gentle O
and O
great O
eye O
" O
, O
Leon B-PER
Verdonk I-PER
knows O
. O

The O
sculptors O
also O
deal O
with O
eroticism O
. O

This O
element O
is O
often O
hidden O
under O
symbols O
, O
but O
sometimes O
also O
clearly O
visible O
. O

Sexuality O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
a O
world O
of O
religion O
and O
magic O
, O
connecting O
power O
and O
means O
of O
integration O
. O

The O
fertility O
of O
women O
stands O
for O
the O
macond B-MISC
synonymous O
with O
life O
, O
as O
the O
power O
given O
by O
the O
Creator O
. O

This O
gives O
sexuality O
a O
sacramental O
character O
, O
whereby O
the O
sex O
organs O
almost O
always O
become O
the O
object O
of O
worship O
. O

Another O
motive O
of O
great O
importance O
is O
the O
Tree O

Life O
, O
which O
is O
to O
represent O
" O
the O

" O

They O
do O

Verdonk B-PER

the O

the O
natural O
people O

That O
is O
why O
he O
could O
never O

the O
question O

more O

than O
the O

The O

something O
uncanny O
, O
they O
express O
what O
the O
macond B-MISC
may O

The O
magical O

100 O

The O

The O
city O
of O
Bad B-LOC
Vilbel I-LOC
therefore O
asked O
the O
circle O
to O
build O
a O
dirty O
water O
channel O
. O

Because O
although O
the O
schoolhouse O
was O
once O
built O
by O
the O
city O
, O
it O
has O
gone O
to O
the O
school O
board O
of O
the O
district O
. O

The O
more O
than O
100,000 O
mark O
expensive O
canal O
construction O
hurts O
very O
much O
the O
circle O
of O
financial O
distress O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
city O

has O
just O
been O
renovated O
for O
around O
600 O

mark O

After O
a O
visit O
on O
Wednesday O
said O
therefore O
Harald B-PER
Mehr I-PER
, O
head O
of O
the O
school O
administration O
in O
Friedberg B-LOC
, O
the O
circle O
would O
rather O
put O
the O
money O
into O
other O
projects O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
for O
the O
school O
board O
, O
they O
would O
have O
received O
permission O
from O
the O
city O
to O
connect O
the O
rainwater O
channel O
to O
the O
dirtywater O
channel O
through O
a O
tapping O
line O
. O

This O
would O
cost O
only O
a O
fraction O
of O
a O
new O
line O
. O

But O
the O
city O
had O
not O
commented O
on O
this O
. O

First O
City O
Councillor O
Klaus B-PER
Minkel I-PER
( O
CDU B-ORG
) O
gives O
concern O
that O
such O
a O
connection O
will O
be O
carefully O
examined O
. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
checked O
how O
much O
rainwater O
could O
flow O
through O
this O
channel O
into O
the O
dirty O
water O
channel O
. O

If O
large O
masses O
of O
water O
could O
flow O
in O
there O
, O
be O
feared O
that O
the O
sewerage O
in O
Frankfurter B-LOC

will O
be O
flooded O
and O
the O
toilet O
contents O
in O
the O

When O
asked O
if O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
close O
the O
sinks O
, O
if O
now O
planned O
to O
build O
the O
new O
canal O
during O
the O
autumn O
holidays O
, O
Minkel B-PER
said O
that O
this O
had O
been O
a O
decision O
of O
the O
circle O
. O

The O
canal O
could O
have O
been O
built O
already O
during O
the O
summer O
holidays O
. O

The O
city O
was O
not O
prepared O
to O
extend O
the O
deadline O
. O

In O
the O

, O
parents O
and O

expressed O
the O
fear O
that O
the O
conflict O
between O
the O
politically O

minds O
in O

would O
now O
be O

headmaster O

in O

the O

In O

it O
is O
not O

that O

also O

For O
nothing O

But O
the O

must O
remain O
in O
the O

for O

, O
says O
the O
headmaster O
. O

The O

sold O

and O
could O
not O
carry O

Spahn B-PER
had O
asked O
at O
a O

Following O
Spahn B-PER

When O

issue O
at O

the O

him O

In O
several O
steps O
Hillach B-PER
then O
tries O
to O
convince O
the O
listeners O
that O
these O
protocols O
will O
become O
quite O
essential O
later O
on O
for O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
theory O
of O
modern O
narration O
. O

Benjamin B-PER
, O
however O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
aware O
of O
the O
significance O
of O
these O
more O
or O

review O

That O
in O
turn O
explains O
Hillach B-PER
with O
a O
Benjamin B-PER
's O
own O
relationship O
to O
death O
, O
a O
dialectical O
connection O
of O
death O
repression O

mythical O
fear O

The O
middle O

to O

forgotten O
Benjamin B-PER

It O
was O
not O
until O
Hillach B-PER
finally O
drew O
a O
bow O
to O
Benjamin B-PER
's I-PER
suicide O
in O
1942 O
in O
Port B-LOC
Bou I-LOC
and O
wondered O
why O
the O
writer O
had O
given O
up O
so O
quickly O
then O
, O
that O
contradiction O
arose O
in O
the O
audience O

There O
have O
been O

deaths O

thrown O

And O
: O

For O
Benjamin B-PER
the O
suicide O
was O
something O
real O
, O
imaginable O
, O
a O
" O
last O
possibility O
" O
, O
but O
also O
a O
" O
heroic O
act O
under O
the O
conditions O
of O
modernity O
" O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
remains O
friendly O
: O

The O
Benjamin B-MISC
fans I-MISC
are O
among O
themselves O
. O

One O
complements O
oneself O
, O
gives O
to O
consider O
, O
appreciates O
the O
common O
interest O
in O
this O
author O
. O

Eckhardt B-PER
Köhn I-PER
also O
meets O
in O
the O
round O
with O
benevolent O
consent O
. O

He O
has O
dealt O
with O
the O
literary O
self O
- O
image O
of O
Benjamin B-PER
and O
insists O
that O
an O
author O
like O
Benjamin B-PER
must O
take O
every O
remark O
about O
his O
own O
writing O
very O
seriously O
. O

The O
self O
- O
proclaim O
" O
One O
last O
as O
I O
am O
" O
serves O
him O
as O
an O
approach O
to O
put O
Benjamin B-PER
in O
the O
tradition O
of O
a O
Mallarmé B-PER
, O
George B-PER
, O
Hofmannsthal B-PER

He O
would O
have O
become O
an O
aestheticist O
poet O
, O
but O
he O
has O
come O
too O
late O

" O

Probably O
the O
event O
would O
have O
been O
more O
contentious O
, O
if O
Barbara B-PER

I O

, O
says O
Thomas B-PER
Regehly I-PER
, O
the O
second O
of O
the O
two O
editors O
, O
" O
whether O
the O
image O

true O
: O

that O
of O

Can O
Schlosser B-PER
imagine O
a O
discussion O
with O
the O
church O
critic O
Eugen B-PER
Drewermann I-PER
? O
" O

Why O
not O
? O
" O

The O
interest O
, O
especially O
among O
young O
people O
, O
would O
certainly O
be O
there O
. O

But O
if O
Drewermann B-PER
would O
come O
to O
a O
place O
like O
Hochheim B-LOC
, O
asks O
Schlosser B-PER
. O

The O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
has O
also O
critically O
illuminated O
another O
topic O
: O

500 O
years O
after O
Columbus B-PER
. O

The O
anniversary O
was O
little O
reason O
for O
the O
members O
to O
celebrate O
, O
but O
rather O
reason O
for O
reflection O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
many O
countries O
, O
they O
help O
to O
alleviate O
the O
consequences O
of O
exploitation O
: O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Brazil B-LOC
, O
where O
a O
project O
is O
intended O
to O
stop O
people O
fleeing O
land O
, O
or O
in O
Nigeria B-LOC
during O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
well O
and O
a O
vocational O
training O
centre O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
only O
far O
from O
home O
that O
we O
need O
to O
do O
something O
for O
our O
fellow O
human O
beings O
. O

It O
is O
precisely O
the O
immigrants O
who O
need O
support O
in O
integrating O
them O
into O
society O
. O

Tips O
on O
tenant O
protection O
, O
social O
law O
and O
other O
everyday O
issues O
are O
necessary O
. O

Schlosser B-PER
's I-PER
example O
: O

" O
The O
insurance O
representatives O
are O
running O
into O
people O
's O
front O
door O
; O
and O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
signing O
. O
" O

So O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
is O
also O
trying O
in O
consumer O
advice O
. O

Such O
engagement O
costs O
not O
only O
time O
, O
but O
also O
money O
. O
" O

We O
just O
have O
to O
do O
a O
lot O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
calls O
as O
a O
source O
of O
finance O
the O
social O
part O
of O
family O
life O
: O

Seven O
events O
to O
carnival O
and O
the O
stand O
at O
the O
wine O
festival O
must O
drop O
enough O
to O
get O
over O
the O
rounds O
. O

And O
of O
course O
, O
donations O
are O
collected O
again O
and O
again O
- O
even O
at O
the O
birthday O
celebration O
for O
the O
70th O
anniversary O
on O
Sunday O
, O
August O
30 O
, O
10.30 O
a.m. O
, O
in O
the O
church O
of O
Peter B-PER
and O
Paul B-PER
. O

The O
money O
is O
to O
go O
to O
Peter B-PER
Osuchukwu I-PER

The O
pastor O
from O
Nigeria B-LOC
wants O
to O
finance O
projects O
in O
his O
native O
community O
. O

But O
the O
commitment O
of O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
seems O
to O
make O
little O
impression O
on O
young O
people O
. O
" O

We O
're O
doing O
it O
like O
everyone O
else O
, O
" O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
pointing O
to O
declining O
numbers O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
to O
be O
offered O
to O
young O
people O
- O
the O
regular O
meetings O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
educational O
leave O
, O
the O
aim O
of O
which O
the O
group O
itself O
chooses O
. O
" O

Well O
" O
, O
says O
Schlosser B-PER
, O
" O
for O
the O
future O
I O
wish O
that O
the O
young O
people O
will O
participate O
more O

Because O
only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
they O
help O
shape O
society O
, O
through O
engagement O
in O
associations O
, O
parties O
or O
in O
the O
Kolping B-ORG
family I-ORG
