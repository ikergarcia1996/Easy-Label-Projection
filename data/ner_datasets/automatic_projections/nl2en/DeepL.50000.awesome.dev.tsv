And O
if O

how O
can O
such O

" O
The O
organizers O
of O
Dranouter B-MISC
have O
been O
asking O
for O
such O
a O
guarantee O
fund O
for O
some O
time O
, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
is O
totally O
separate O
from O
the O
structural O
or O
project O

granted O

" O
Perhaps O

Ten O

go O

I O
would O
like O
to O
arrive O
at O
a O
system O

an O

temporarily O
granted O
an O
interest O

free O
bridging O

simply O
paid O

" O

If O
they O
qualify O
for O

then O
the O
burden O

also O
the O

Therefore O
, O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
even O
a O
temporary O
contribution O
to O
the O
structural O
operating O
funds O
may O
be O
necessary O

" O

It O
is O
not O

Every O

involves O
a O

it O
must O
also O
involve O

if O
this O

not O

develop O
into O
a O
totally O

therefore O
an O

with O
a O
pronounced O
preference O

of O
our O

deeply O

ethical O
rules O
: O
you O
have O

In O

if O

you O

Although O
it O

Then O
it O

something O

" O

Moreels B-PER
went O
to O
ask O
for O

" O
Placing O
the O
watercress O

is O
part O
of O
an O
overall O
plan O
to O
renovate O
all O
the O
villages O
in O
the O
Zwalm B-MISC
region O
, O
" O
explained O
Eeckhout B-PER
. O

But O
the O
construction O
is O
clearly O
not O
to O
the O
liking O
of O
some O
villagers O
. O

After O
much O
insistence O
, O
they O
finally O
admitted O
yesterday O
that O
the O
municipality O
has O
a O
small O
problem O
: O
the O
permit O
to O
build O
the O
fountain O
is O
not O
yet O
in O
order O

" O
In O
Rooborst B-LOC

the O
old O
cobblestones O
have O
already O
been O
renewed O

there O
are O
still O
some O

Each O

also O
have O
a O

paying O
tribute O
to O
the O

So O
it O

just O
a O

" O
We O
have O
always O
known O
that O
something O
mysterious O
was O
going O
on O
" O

states O
Patrick B-PER

, O
who O
lives O
right O
across O
from O
the O
future O
statue O

We O
were O
only O
told O
that O
a O
large O
fountain O
was O
coming O
, O
containing O
a O
statue O
of O
the O
watercress O
picker O
. O
" O

He O

that O
there O
is O
a O

perhaps O
even O
before O
the O

" O
Surely O
we O
can O
not O

it O
that O

the O

yesterday O
and O

an O
official O
report O
drawn O
up O

According O
to O
Eeckhout B-PER

the O
fact O
that O
he O
did O
not O
yet O
have O
a O
building O

when O
he O
started O
the O
construction O

only O
a O

will O
not O

for O
extravagant O

in O

Brogno B-PER

sign O
a O

The O

wants O
him O
to O
sign O
a O
lucrative O
transfer O
but O
would O
just O
as O
soon O
keep O
him O
on O

The O
main O
culprit O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
Westerlo B-LOC
is O
Dante B-PER
Brogno I-PER
, O
who O
offered O
his O
brother O
via O
managers O
all O
over O
Europe B-LOC
at O
a O
price O
far O
below O

at O
a O
time O
when O
European B-MISC
regulations O
did O
not O
allow O

The O
French B-MISC
club O
Metz B-LOC
made O
an O
offer O
in O
early O
July O

far O
- O
reaching O
talks O
with O
the O

also O
followed O

" O
That O
was O
certainly O
a O
disillusionment O
for O
Toni B-PER
" O
, O
explains O
Wijnants B-PER
. O

" O
But O
if O
you O
as O
a O
top O
shooter O
do O
not O
find O
a O
team O
that O
you O
want O
, O
then O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
yourself O
questions O
about O
that O
. O

We O
certainly O
did O
not O
ask O
hundreds O
of O
millions O
for O
Toni B-PER
, O
but O
when O
you O
see O
that O
Standard B-ORG
bought I-ORG
Årst I-ORG
for O
120 O
million O
and O
that O
Strupar B-PER
was O
transferred O
for O

then O
proposals O
of O
around O
20 O
million O
are O
surely O
not O
to O
be O
taken O
seriously O

" O

So O
suddenly O
there O
was O
Racing B-ORG
Genk I-ORG
who O
in O

could O

We O
try O
to O
give O
the O

confidence O

obtain O
the O
truth O

Because O
estimates O
of O
the O
total O

vary O
widely O
, O
a O
national O

was O

Tutsi B-MISC

But O
the O

has O
more O
