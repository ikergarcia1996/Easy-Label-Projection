Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer. O

We, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
tiny. O

After O
all O
that, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip. O

Avoid O
this O
place B-TARGET
! O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
Saul, O
many O
times, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
consistently, O
outrageously O
good. O

Saul B-TARGET
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn. O

The O
duck B-TARGET
confit I-TARGET
is O
always O
amazing O
and O
the O
foie B-TARGET
gras I-TARGET
terrine I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
figs I-TARGET
was O
out O
of O
this O
world. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values. O

For O
the O
price, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-TARGET
attendant I-TARGET
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
okay, O
nothing O
great. O

Chow B-TARGET
fun I-TARGET
was O
dry; O
pork B-TARGET
shu I-TARGET
mai I-TARGET
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family. O

I/we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
again. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge, O
with O
Fish B-TARGET
bringing O
up O
the O
closing, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
O O
trip O
ended, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great! O

Service B-TARGET
was O
devine, O
oysters B-TARGET
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come, O
and O
the O
price O
can't O
be O
beat!!! O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant B-TARGET
Saul I-TARGET
on O
Smith O
Street. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
cool O
and O
understated. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-TARGET
breast I-TARGET
special I-TARGET
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible. O

Can't O
wait O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
'give O
it O
a O
try.' O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I'll O
ever O
go O
back. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
average...the O
Thai B-TARGET
fusion I-TARGET
stuff I-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled B-TARGET
Chicken I-TARGET
special I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Edamame I-TARGET
Puree I-TARGET
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-TARGET
pureed I-TARGET
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
(could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt). O

Anyways, O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food, O
I O
wouldn't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
night O
tho...but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-TARGET
in O
the O
ceiling...its O
quite O
un-appetizing, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-TARGET
look O
sleek O
and O
modern. O

We O
ate O
outside O
at O
Haru's O
Sake O
bar O
because O
Haru's O
restaurant O
next O
door O
was O
overflowing. O

What's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two? O

Their O
sake B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
was O
extensive, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze, O
which O
wasn't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request! O

The O
spicy B-TARGET
tuna I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
was O
awesome, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share! O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
great! O

we O
love O
th O
pink B-TARGET
pony I-TARGET
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot B-TARGET
. O

Food B-TARGET
-awesome. O

Service B-TARGET
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

Ambiance B-TARGET
- O
relaxed O
and O
stylish. O

Don't O
judge O
this O
place B-TARGET
prima O
facie, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
a O
handful O
of O
times, O
for O
no O
reason O
besides O
sheer O
convenience. O

(i O
hang O
out, O
and O
live, O
in O
the O
neighborhood..) O

the O
food B-TARGET
is O
decent. O

however, O
it's O
the O
service B-TARGET
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self-respect, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
intimidate O
me, O
i.e. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water, O
or O
the O
check. O

i O
know, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience. O

well, O
i O
didn't O
find O
it O
there, O
and O
trust, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty. O
hmmm. O

This O
place B-TARGET
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
experience. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
top O
notch. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-TARGET
urchin I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose. O

It O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect O
consistency-not O
too O
fishy, O
creamy, O
and O
slightly O
buttery. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
ration I-TARGET
was O
also O
good--they O
didn't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice. O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-TARGET
price I-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
deal I-TARGET
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it. O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently. O

She O
lives O
nearby O
but O
had O
never O
gone O
to O
this O
establishment O
thinking O
that O
it O
might O
be O
too O
touristy. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth. O

In O
the O
evening, O
this O
place O
attracted O
a O
well O
dressed, O
with O
it, O
NY O
crowd B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
impecable. O

I'm O
going O
back. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet, O
romantic, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot. O

Quite O
simply O
it's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive, O
yet O
unimposing, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced. O

The O
Prix B-TARGET
Fixe I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
(both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality). O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend O
it! O

I've O
had O
the O
lunch O
buffet O
at O
Chennai O
a O
couple O
of O
times, O
when O
I O
have O
been O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

It O
is O
terrific, O
as O
is O
the O
value. O

$6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty O
food B-TARGET
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh O
and O
continually O
refilled. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
great. O

Frankly, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison. O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy. O

The O
food B-TARGET
here O
is O
rather O
good, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-TARGET
, O
chai B-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
chole B-TARGET
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-TARGET
and O
dhal B-TARGET
were O
kinda O
dissapointing. O

The O
service B-TARGET
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they're O
very O
nice, O
and O
sometimes O
not. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
however, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow. O

Also, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-TARGET
spicy- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
don't. O

The O
ambience B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday. O

If O
you've O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
Weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-TARGET
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service B-TARGET
and O
great O
food B-TARGET
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening. O

The O
lava B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it. O

Once O
you O
step O
into O
Cosette B-TARGET
, O
you're O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small, O
off-the-beaten O
path O
Parisian O
bistro. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
average O
to O
above-average; O
the O
French B-TARGET
Onion I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive, O
and O
the O
desserts B-TARGET
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way. O

However, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-TARGET
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-TARGET
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
however, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted! O

It O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst. O

This O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
overpriced O
and O
soggy. O

Yes, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-TARGET
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
don't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-TARGET
right. O

A O
big O
disappointment, O
all O
around. O

I O
think O
I've O
had O
some O
the O
best O
meals B-TARGET
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow. O

The O
seafood B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
there's O
a O
good O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B-TARGET
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises. O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B-TARGET
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night. O

Best O
Pastrami B-TARGET
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-TARGET
without O
being O
ridiculous. O

And O
I've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native, O
I've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get. O

The O
signs B-TARGET
, O
the O
specials B-TARGET
menus I-TARGET
, O
food B-TARGET
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-TARGET
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can. O

Leon B-TARGET
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem: O
casual O
but O
hip, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French B-TARGET
bistro I-TARGET
fare I-TARGET
, O
good O
specials B-TARGET
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere B-TARGET
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly, O
staff B-TARGET
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story. O

Sit O
outside O
in O
the O
warm O
weather; O
inside O
for O
cozy O
winter. O

Decent O
wine B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience. O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it, O
too. O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero B-TARGET
Pomodori I-TARGET
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
my O
favorite O
place B-TARGET
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
great, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions B-TARGET
. O

You'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city, O
and O
most O
still O
don't O
compare. O

I'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-TARGET
. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
incredibly O
tiny. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
bland O
oily. O

I O
just O
don't O
understand O
all O
the O
hype... O

We O
went O
to O
Ino O
for O
Valentines. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-TARGET
, O
wine B-TARGET
, O
and O
service B-TARGET
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-TARGET
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
while O
we O
waited. O

When O
we O
sat, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service B-TARGET
. O

The O
people B-TARGET
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-TARGET
as O
often O
as O
you O
can. O

This O
is O
a O
fun O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
go O
to. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-TARGET
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
way O
to O
expensive. O

A O
large O
is O
$20, O
and O
toppings B-TARGET
are O
about O
$3 O
each. O

I O
went O
there O
for O
lunch B-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
not O
as O
good O
as O
I O
expected O
from O
the O
reviews O
I O
read. O

Sauce B-TARGET
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
didn't O
have O
much O
flavor. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
great. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
phenomenal! O

Service B-TARGET
was O
prompt, O
friendly O
and O
great. O

Slightly O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
but O
worth O
it! O

Great O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
service B-TARGET
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait B-TARGET
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected. O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block B-TARGET
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside..... O

I O
will O
be O
back! O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-TARGET
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic. O

Get O
the O
tuna B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
gari I-TARGET
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side. O

Planet B-TARGET
Thailand I-TARGET
has O
always O
been O
a O
hit O
with O
me O
, O
I O
go O
there O
usually O
for O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
, O
which O
is O
great O
, O
the O
thai B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
excellent O
too O
. O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
isn't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

It's O
all O
about O
the O
food B-TARGET
!! O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place B-TARGET
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu B-TARGET
, O
there O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi. O

those O
rolls B-TARGET
were O
big, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi B-TARGET
wasn't O
fresh. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting, O
i O
didn't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece. O

Hurley's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came. O

Try O
the O
crunchy B-TARGET
tuna I-TARGET
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for. O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter, O
it O
is O
all O
good. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can't O
get O
enough. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-TARGET
terrace I-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
amazing, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful, O
but O
not O
over-bearing O
or O
rushed. O

The O
Steak B-TARGET
Tartare I-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
bet, O
they O
fix O
it O
for O
you O
at O
the O
table. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
were O
rather O
warm, O
but O
the O
open B-TARGET
kitchen I-TARGET
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm. O

Great O
wine B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
, O
Gigondas B-TARGET
is O
worth O
the O
price, O
and O
the O
house B-TARGET
champagne I-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
value. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends, O
but O
the O
vibe B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area. O

Have O
recommended O
the O
place B-TARGET
to O
friends, O
always O
gets O
good O
response. O

Pizza O
- O
the O
only O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
NYC O
that O
should O
not O
have O
additional O
toppings O
- O
the O
crust B-TARGET
tastes O
like O
the O
best, O
freshly O
baked O
bread! O

Veal O
Parmigana O
- O
Better O
than O
Patsy's! O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too! O

I O
take O
all O
my O
NYC O
guests O
to O
VT's B-TARGET
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer, O
lonk, O
dined, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-TARGET
and O
has O
great O
food B-TARGET
! O

I've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences. O

I'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
-- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-TARGET
and O
nice O
service B-TARGET
. O

I'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu B-TARGET
very O
much... O
and O
we're O
repeat O
customers. O

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
the O
Spicy B-TARGET
Scallop I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
.. O
. O

it's O
delicious! O

Moules B-TARGET
were O
excellent, O
lobster B-TARGET
ravioli I-TARGET
was O
VERY O
salty! O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother's O
Day, O
and O
the O
maitre B-TARGET
d' I-TARGET
was O
pretty O
rude. O

Told O
us O
to O
sit O
anywhere, O
and O
when O
we O
sat O
he O
said O
the O
table O
was O
reserved. O

Stepped O
on O
my O
foot O
on O
the O
SECOND O
time O
he O
reached O
over O
me O
to O
adjust O
lighting. O

Tiny O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
$8.00...just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is. O

The O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
is O
fairly O
priced. O

Try O
their O
chef's B-TARGET
specials I-TARGET
-- O
they O
are O
to O
die O
for. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal. O

Downstairs B-TARGET
lounge I-TARGET
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

Raga's B-TARGET
is O
a O
romantic, O
cozy O
restaurant. O

The O
exotic B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
beautifully O
presented O
and O
is O
a O
delight O
in O
delicious O
combinations. O

It O
is O
also O
extremely O
well O
priced. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive. O

The O
bar B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers B-TARGET
and O
well O
priced O
wines B-TARGET
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed. O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem! O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon B-TARGET
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet, O
we O
were O
told O
no... O

Then, O
to O
top O
things O
off, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes. O

Such O
a O
disappointment... O

Rude O
service B-TARGET
, O
medicore O
food B-TARGET
...there O
are O
tons O
of O
restaurants O
in O
NY...stay O
away O
from O
this O
one O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Hyde I-TARGET
! O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it-especially O
the O
shows B-TARGET
and O
actors B-TARGET
. O

Our O
server B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly. O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O
whole O
family O
back O
next O
time. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
too. O

The O
tuna B-TARGET
and O
wasabe B-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

The O
outdoor B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful. O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped, O
but O
to O
be O
expected. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
prompt O
and O
courteous. O

This O
was O
a O
repeat O
visit O
and O
we'll O
definitely O
be O
back O
again. O

Great O
service B-TARGET
, O
great O
food B-TARGET
. O

Prices O
are O
in O
line. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down. O

But O
too O
far O
east! O

I O
live O
a O
block O
away O
and O
go O
to O
Patsy's O
frequently. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh B-TARGET
mozzarella I-TARGET
instead O
of O
the O
cheap, O
frozen, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's. O

Two O
complaints- O
their O
appetizer B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
stinks, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu. O

Also, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot. O

Wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie B-TARGET
on O
the O
UWS! O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-TARGET
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant. O

fine O
dining B-TARGET
restaurant O
quality. O

Over O
100 O
different O
choices O
to O
create O
your O
own. O

A O
must O
try! O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT. O

This O
was O
the O
perfect O
quiet, O
relaxing, O
and O
delicious O
accompaniment O
to O
our O
afternoon O
of O
theater. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
pot I-TARGET
pie I-TARGET
is O
excpetiona, O
the O
cheeseburger B-TARGET
huge O
and O
delictable, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
professional O
wan O
warm. O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find! O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid-town. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
no O
nonsense. O

The O
food B-TARGET
options O
rule. O

When O
I O
lived O
upstate O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
buy O
freeze O
the O
bagels B-TARGET
and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better O
than O
any O
else. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st B-TARGET
Ave I-TARGET
spot I-TARGET
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
second O
floor O
walk-up O
two O
Fridays O
ago O
when O
I O
was O
with O
two O
friends O
in O
town O
from O
L.A. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni. O
( O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don't O
know, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite.) O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni B-TARGET
Hand I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you...IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN! O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin, O
the O
chef O
recommended O
an O
assortment O
of O
fish O
including O
Fatty O
Yellow O
Tail, O
Boton O
Shrimp, O
Blue O
Fin O
Torro O
(Fatty O
Tuna), O
Sea O
Eel, O
etc. O

The O
sake B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
should O
not O
be O
overlooked! O

All O
in O
all, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city. O

Try O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
teriyaki I-TARGET
and O
the O
rose B-TARGET
special I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
. O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$35 O
menu. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt, O
attentive O
and O
non-intrusive. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
as O
well, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
(though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork B-TARGET
belly I-TARGET
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt-in-your-mouth O
experience). O

Wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
wine-by-the-glass B-TARGET
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top. O

Traditional B-TARGET
French I-TARGET
decour I-TARGET
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-TARGET
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation. O

I've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-TARGET
Spice I-TARGET
probably O
5-8 O
times, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square. O

To O
sum O
it O
up: O
Service B-TARGET
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok. O

Seating B-TARGET
is O
always O
prompt, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
usually O
very O
good, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw B-TARGET
vegatables I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
side I-TARGET
orders I-TARGET
. O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private B-TARGET
boths I-TARGET
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O
disappointed O
in O
the O
Red B-TARGET
Eye I-TARGET
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live B-TARGET
jazz I-TARGET
band I-TARGET
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad. O

I've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu...there's O
no O
need O
to. O

It's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-TARGET
in O
NYC. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red B-TARGET
Eye I-TARGET
Grill I-TARGET
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

We've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
a O
diamond O
in O
rough O
-- O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
homemade O
with O
the O
perfect O
balance B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
herbs I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

It's O
one O
of O
our O
favorite O
places O
to O
eat O
in O
NY. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
hyde I-TARGET
Pub I-TARGET
last O
night. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks. O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-TARGET
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner. O

The O
server B-TARGET
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile. O

The O
place's O
decor B-TARGET
and O
hidden B-TARGET
bathrooms I-TARGET
made O
for O
a O
good O
laugh. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks! O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
and O
eat. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
thougt O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Jekyll B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Hyde I-TARGET
Pub I-TARGET
for O
our O
anniversary, O
and O
to O
our O
surprise O
it O
was O
fantastic. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers B-TARGET
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin B-TARGET
tortelini I-TARGET
. O

The O
entertainment O
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner. O

Please O
take O
my O
advice, O
go O
and O
try O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village. O

You O
will O
not O
be O
disapointed O
at O
all. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel. O

We O
were O
not O
dissappointed O
in O
the O
least O
bit O
by O
this O
little O
gem. O

The O
bagel B-TARGET
was O
huge. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel B-TARGET
with O
cream O
cheese O
(gets O
a O
little O
messy). O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
HIGHLY O
RECOMMEND. O

This O
was O
my O
frist O
time O
at O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart's O
and O
I O
must O
say O
how O
delicous O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was. O

When O
I O
called O
this O
morning, O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
12, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in, O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests. O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O
lobster B-TARGET
. O

Other O
guests O
enjoyed O
pizza B-TARGET
, O
santa B-TARGET
fe I-TARGET
chopped I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
fish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart's O
for O
their O
food B-TARGET
, O
the O
ambience B-TARGET
and O
wonderful O
service B-TARGET
. O

All O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
absolutely O
professional!! O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
don't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes. O

But O
they O
do. O

(that O
is O
A O
MUST, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do...) O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party, O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT. O

There's O
nice O
and O
quiet, O
small O
but O
enough O
for O
6 O
(or O
more). O

This O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
way O
overhyped. O

My O
chow B-TARGET
fun I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chow I-TARGET
see I-TARGET
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily. O

Okay-i O
don't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
(cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland. O

The O
scallion B-TARGET
pancakes I-TARGET
and O
fried B-TARGET
dumplings I-TARGET
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

It's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside, O
and O
our O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
below O
average... O
the O
tuna B-TARGET
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-TARGET
had O
no O
flavor. O

I O
definitely O
wouldn't O
go O
back. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
#1. O

Their O
pad B-TARGET
penang I-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
poor. O

fresh B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
amazing........ O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh. O

great O
for O
a O
romantic O
evening, O
or O
a O
fun O
evening O
with O
friends... O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon. O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work. O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef B-TARGET
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is. O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine. O

It O
was O
wonderful. O

the O
salads B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy. O

We O
had O
Pam's B-TARGET
special I-TARGET
fried I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
amazing. O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left. O

Unbelievable. O

Had O
a O
late O
night O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

Great O
vibe B-TARGET
, O
lots O
of O
people. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak, O
medium. O

My O
husbands O
was O
perfect, O
my O
was O
well O
done O
and O
dry. O

I O
didn't O
complain, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
so O
much. O

Will O
give O
it O
another O
chance O
before O
I O
write O
it O
off. O

Visited O
there O
while O
on O
vacation O
and O
reading O
the O
reviews. O

On O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous O
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch. O

Ambience B-TARGET
is O
so O
cute O
and O
quaint, O
good O
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation. O

Salads B-TARGET
were O
fantastic. O

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-TARGET
we O
got O
were O
great. O

Ingredients B-TARGET
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me. O

We O
will O
be O
back. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-TARGET
. O

It O
costs O
$2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size, O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice. O

The O
spicy B-TARGET
Tuna I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range. O

The O
Yellowtail B-TARGET
was O
particularly O
good O
as O
well. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B-TARGET
you I-TARGET
can I-TARGET
eat I-TARGET
deal I-TARGET
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu. O

In O
any O
event, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-TARGET
I'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town. O

Big B-TARGET
Wong I-TARGET
gets O
big O
Ups O
for O
a O
fine O
establishment. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
-- O
great O
price, O
food B-TARGET
, O
and O
service B-TARGET
. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can. O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
efficiently. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee B-TARGET
, O
noodles B-TARGET
, O
and O
rice B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
no O
more O
than O
$3-6 O
each). O

The O
takeout B-TARGET
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular. O

Went O
here O
on O
a O
friend's O
reccomendation. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar B-TARGET
Salad I-TARGET
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
....both O
very O
tasty. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh. O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-TARGET
chocolate B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
, O
both O
were O
delicious. O

We'd O
go O
back O
again O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
accomodating, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
lovely. O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager B-TARGET
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves. O

Yes, O
the O
prices O
are O
high, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O

We O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
ok O
service B-TARGET
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B-TARGET
and O
bad O
service B-TARGET
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
good B-TARGET
and O
bad O
service B-TARGET
. O

it O
is O
not O
consistent. O

really O
depends O
on O
your O
luck! O

The O
place O
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means: O
simple O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
served O
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere B-TARGET
. O

And O
where O
does O
Patis B-TARGET
go O
wrong; O
no O
where. O

You O
are O
not O
eating O
haut O
cuisine O
with O
subtle O
hints O
of O
whatever O
but: O
Cassuolet, O
Steake O
Fritte, O
Tripe O
Stew, O
etc; O
simple O
stuff. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-TARGET
is O
simply O
wonderful. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place B-TARGET
with O
good O
pizza B-TARGET
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-TARGET
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though). O

My O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
which O
tasted O
better. O

The O
sangria B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-TARGET
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids. O

Overall O
I O
would O
recommend O
it O
and O
go O
back O
again. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
(although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings!) O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka-masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan. O

MMmmm... O
it O
was O
delicious. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
slow, O
but O
the O
people B-TARGET
were O
friendly. O

It's O
a O
nice O
place B-TARGET
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation. O

I O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back. O

We O
have O
lived O
in O
Chelsea O
for O
two O
years O
and O
have O
never O
noticed O
this O
restaurant. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious! O

Pizza B-TARGET
is O
terrific, O
as O
is O
homemade B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
. O

Ambience B-TARGET
is O
delightful, O
service B-TARGET
impeccable. O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
hanger B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-TARGET
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-TARGET
is O
not O
that O
great. O

DO O
not O
try O
unless O
you're O
just O
going O
there O
to O
hang O
out O
like O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
hipsters O
who O
apparently O
have O
no O
sense O
of O
taste. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-TARGET
you O
have O
go O
and O
try. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

The O
filet B-TARGET
mignon I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
was O
superb! O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices. O

It's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place B-TARGET
!!! O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse. O

I O
like O
the O
ambience B-TARGET
, O
it's O
very O
dark O
and O
original. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
is O
amazing!!! O

And O
amazingly O
cheap. O

Big O
thumbs O
up! O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-TARGET
! O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
noodle I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed. O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
. O

However, O
I O
think O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
hang O
out O
spot. O

Next O
time, O
we O
wouldn't O
dare O
ordering O
anything O
else O
other O
than O
some O
simple O
Asian O
appetizers O
and O
drinks. O

My O
Girlfriend O
and O
I O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-TARGET
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great O
time! O

THe O
Pizza B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
were O
excellent-the O
service B-TARGET
too--but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-TARGET
dining I-TARGET
area I-TARGET
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor O
restaurants O
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY--I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter, O
so O
i'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it. O

Check O
this O
place B-TARGET
out! O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED!!!!! O

First O
of O
all, O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
*not* O
romantic, O
as O
claimed O
by O
Citysearch's O
editorial O
review. O

Either O
that, O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th. O

The O
tables B-TARGET
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close, O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
simply O
overpriced. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines B-TARGET
start O
at O
$70+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$30+. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
not O
what O
one O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category. O

For O
instance, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down, O
etc.... O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service B-TARGET
. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
above O
average, O
but O
couldn't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B-TARGET
. O

To O
celebrate O
a O
birthday, O
three O
of O
us O
went O
to O
Mare O
anticipating O
great O
food. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-TARGET
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and/or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
orange I-TARGET
flavoring I-TARGET
. O

Fish B-TARGET
was O
overdone. O

Cute O
place B-TARGET
, O
nice O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
- O
we O
also O
left O
that. O

One O
of O
us O
actually O
liked O
the O
expresso B-TARGET
- O
that's O
it. O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
, O
it's O
a O
big O
disappointment. O

Myagi B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
in O
the O
City; O
the O
place O
the O
negative O
reviews O
describe O
sound O
like O
they O
were O
somewhere O
else. O

I've O
never O
had O
bad O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious. O

Their O
tuna B-TARGET
tartar I-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
is O
to O
die O
for. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners, O
and O
I'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
Fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away. O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B-TARGET
a O
try. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often. O

P.S. O
Please O
don't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there. O

LOL O

A O
restaurant O
that O
doesn't O
try O
to O
do O
anything O
except O
serve O
great O
food B-TARGET
with O
great O
service B-TARGET
in O
a O
pleasant O
atmosphere B-TARGET
. O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
-- O
the O
food B-TARGET
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation. O

The O
dining B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music O
to O
shout O
over O
-- O
how O
refreshing! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
-- O
the O
staff B-TARGET
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
-- O
to O
know O
their O
menu, O
present O
your O
meal, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs. O

Looking O
around, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal B-TARGET
in O
a O
real O
restaurant B-TARGET
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen. O

Beautiful O
experience. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
top O
notch... O
the O
ambiance B-TARGET
is O
wonderfull. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
offers O
impeccable O
service. O

I O
had O
Lobster B-TARGET
Bisque I-TARGET
it O
has O
2 O
oz. O
of O
Maine O
Lobster O
in O
it. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-TARGET
England I-TARGET
Chowder I-TARGET
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-TARGET
Bisque I-TARGET
. O

I O
had O
Filet O
Mignon O
with O
garlic O
mash. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
Prime B-TARGET
Rib I-TARGET
it O
was O
good O
. O

We O
didn't O
want O
a O
bottle O
of O
bubbly O
on O
a O
weekday O
so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
Korbett I-TARGET
it O
was O
just O
enough. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/2 O
to O
make O
it. O

It's O
cuz O
it's O
so O
good O
you O
need O
to O
taste O
it!!! O

All O
in O
all O
we're O
already O
coming O
up O
with O
excuses O
to O
go O
ahead O
really O
soon O
in O
the O
next O
few O
wks!!!! O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
ate O
here O
earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
vindaloo I-TARGET
. O

It's O
very O
spicy O
but O
not O
offensive. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-TARGET
and O
terrific O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
large O
and O
the O
servers B-TARGET
always O
surprise O
us O
with O
a O
different O
starter. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
amazing... O
especially O
if O
you O
get O
the O
Chef's B-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
and O
your O
favourite O
bottle O
(or O
two!) O
of O
wine O
from O
an O
extensive O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
it's O
great O
for O
friends O
out, O
a O
romantic O
date, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion. O

People O
dress O
in O
suits O
or O
evening O
gowns O
as O
well O
as O
shirts O
jeans. O

The O
food B-TARGET
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe B-TARGET
fixe I-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
don't O
like. O

Recommendations, O
of O
course, O
are O
required! O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only! O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering, O
the O
food B-TARGET
here O
was O
decent, O
not O
great. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees. O

We O
ordered O
the O
special, O
grilled B-TARGET
branzino I-TARGET
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic, O
just O
simple, O
small O
and O
sparse. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune B-TARGET
is O
particularly O
memorable. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
so O
much O
fun. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

This O
place O
must O
have O
cost O
the O
owners O
afortune O
to O
build. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney. O

Our O
food B-TARGET
was O
great O
too! O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-TARGET
. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
really O
different O
than O
try O
Jekyll B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Hyde I-TARGET
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions B-TARGET
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun. O

My O
six O
year O
old O
loved O
it. O

The O
characters B-TARGET
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience. O

The O
food B-TARGET
however, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect. O

It O
is O
very O
overpriced O
and O
not O
very O
tasty. O

However, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Hydes I-TARGET
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once. O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded. O

Drinks B-TARGET
way O
over O
priced. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

Great O
pizza B-TARGET
for O
lunch O
place. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
quick. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
great. O

And O
it O
was O
quick O
which O
is O
very O
important. O

Have O
the O
iced B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
. O

It O
was O
wonderful. O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish B-TARGET
and O
great O
service B-TARGET
. O

Delivery B-TARGET
is O
fast O
too. O

Great O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
, O
Fast O
seating B-TARGET
, O
Fast O
Delivery B-TARGET
, O
Excellent O
sushi B-TARGET
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite. O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels. O

Ess-A-Bagel O
(either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-TARGET
in O
NY. O

The O
bagels B-TARGET
always O
warm, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size. O

They O
have O
a O
huge O
selection O
of O
different O
cream B-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
and O
all O
of O
their O
salads B-TARGET
are O
great. O

The O
lox B-TARGET
is O
always O
fresh O
too. O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all! O

I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
previous O
reviewer. O

I O
don't O
get O
it O
either. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

Prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant B-TARGET
. O

Zero O
ambiance B-TARGET
to O
boot. O

I O
thought O
this O
place B-TARGET
was O
totally O
overrated. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok....but O
definitely O
nothing O
great. O

The O
ambience B-TARGET
was O
nice, O
but O
service B-TARGET
wasn't O
so O
great. O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together, O
it O
just O
doesn't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me...especially O
considering O
the O
prices. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu-Shabu B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
in O
the O
Try-State O
Area. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
feel B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan. O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu-Shabu B-TARGET
. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special, O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
a O
Sushi O
establishment O
in O
Tokyo. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance B-TARGET
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-TARGET
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food O
art. O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars! O

Taxan B-TARGET
delicious! O

Arigato O
Gozimas O
Yuka! O

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
local...as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed! O

We O
weren't! O

The O
prices O
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
food B-TARGET
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch. O

The O
location B-TARGET
and O
ambience B-TARGET
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me. O

Try O
green B-TARGET
curry I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
. O

The O
quantity O
is O
also O
very O
good, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
ok, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
didn't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
sat. O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time. O

I O
had O
the O
best O
ravioli B-TARGET
ever. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
too. O

Moderate O
prices. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party! O

Molto O
bene! O

This O
quaint O
and O
romantic O
trattoria B-TARGET
is O
at O
the O
top O
of O
my O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
list. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
- O
from O
the O
specials B-TARGET
to O
the O
regular B-TARGET
menu-fare I-TARGET
, O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
never O
a O
disappointment. O

Whether O
it's O
the O
parmesean B-TARGET
porcini I-TARGET
souffle I-TARGET
or O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
glazed I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
balsamic I-TARGET
vinegar I-TARGET
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite. O

Although O
the O
tables B-TARGET
may O
be O
closely O
situated, O
the O
candle-light B-TARGET
, O
food B-TARGET
-quality O
and O
service B-TARGET
overcompensate. O

A O
guaranteeed O
delight! O

I O
have O
known O
about O
this O
secret O
for O
the O
last O
13 O
years, O
Emilio(the O
Godfather) O
has O
continued O
to O
serve O
food B-TARGET
and O
wine B-TARGET
for O
the O
gods O
at O
mortal O
prices. O

If O
you O
go, O
try O
the O
marinara/arrabiatta B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
, O
the O
mozzarella B-TARGET
en I-TARGET
Carozza I-TARGET
is O
mmmmmmmm..... O
everything O
is O
just O
delicious. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
. O

Old O
school O
meets O
New O
world. O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever. O

Thank O
You O
Emilio B-TARGET
. O

Ciao O
Bella O

I O
found O
the O
food B-TARGET
, O
service B-TARGET
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
authentic. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive. O

The O
prices O
are O
wonderfully O
low. O

Very O
good O
wine B-TARGET
choices I-TARGET
. O

I O
can't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks? O

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
NYC! O

Get O
the O
pepperoni B-TARGET
- O
YUM O
- O
and O
a O
family B-TARGET
style I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
. O

Great O
staff B-TARGET
. O

Always O
great O
service B-TARGET
! O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month! O

Fantastic! O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I O
can't O
lie. O

But O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
so O
horrible O
to O
us. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
and O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out. O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
pricey, O
and O
yes, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
worth O
it; O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one! O

I'll O
keep O
this O
short. O

Amma B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special. O

The O
two O
star O
chefs O
left O
quite O
some O
time O
ago O
to O
open O
their O
own O
place. O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes B-TARGET
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive. O

Will O
not O
be O
back. O

Don't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non-veg B-TARGET
selections I-TARGET
. O

is O
nice O
though O
service B-TARGET
can O
be O
spotty. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
always O
packed. O

I O
know O
because O
I O
live O
nearby. O

Most O
importantly, O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Try O
the O
sea B-TARGET

Highly O
recommended. O

First O
of O
all O
Dal B-TARGET
Bukhara I-TARGET
Rocks. O

As O
a O
student O
in O
NYU O
i O
need O
a O
place O
to O
eat O
after O
a O
hard O
day O
of O
work O
so O
usually O
i O
just O
go O
to O
any O
indian O
restraunt O
near O
by. O

but O
ive O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
yrs O
and O
finally O
decided O
to O
eat O
here. O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
awsome. O

JUST O
AWSOME. O

and O
yes O
Dal B-TARGET
Bukhara I-TARGET
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs B-TARGET
. O

They O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
Yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O

but O
overall O
i O
give O
it O
a O

I O
haven't O
been O
to O
the O
other O
locations. O

Haru B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
Park I-TARGET
S I-TARGET
is O
simply O
disgusting. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-TARGET
tasted O
old O
and O
stale. O

Quite O
frankly, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
tried. O

Will O
never O
be O
back. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi B-TARGET
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives. O

believe O
us, O
we've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly. O

the O
all-u-can-eat B-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality. O

limited O
menu B-TARGET
, O
no-so-fresh O
ingredients B-TARGET
, O
thinly-sliced O
fish B-TARGET
, O
fall-apart O
rice B-TARGET
. O

the O
only O
things O
u O
could O
really O
taste O
are O
the O
very O
salty O
soy B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
(even O
its O
low O
sodium), O
the O
vinegar-soaked O
rice B-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
scallion O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fish. O

the O
waitstaffs B-TARGET
are O
nice O
though. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Roth's B-TARGET
twice O
and O
both O
times O
were O
very O
disappointing. O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service B-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude. O

They O
wouldnt O
even O
let O
me O
finish O
my O
glass O
of O
wine O
before O
offering O
another. O

Much O
of O
the O
time O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
about O
you. O

The O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again. O

I O
had O
their O
eggs B-TARGET
benedict I-TARGET
for O
brunch, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was. O

This O
was O
a O
great O
surprise. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal B-TARGET
in O
a O
beautiful O
room B-TARGET
. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

Planet B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
is O
great! O

We O
love O
the O
food B-TARGET
, O
drinks B-TARGET
, O
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
! O

The O
svc B-TARGET
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
must! O

Try O
the O
Pad B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
, O
it's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap! O

Just O
because O
it's O
cheap O
does O
NOT O
mean O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small O
or O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
nasty, O
IT O
IS O
GREAT! O

Just O
remember, O
the O
later O
you O
go, O
the O
longer O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait. O

It's O
popular O
w/the O
late O
crowd. O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich, O
didn't O
include O
plastic O
forks, O
and O
didn't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter. O

Also, O
the O
sandwiches B-TARGET
(nearing O
$7) O
didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O
chips O
or O
a O
side. O

Overall, O
not O
worth O
the O
money. O

Eating O
in, O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
saves O
it, O
but O
at O
your O
desk, O
it's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it. O

Chennai B-TARGET
Garden I-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-TARGET
at O
amazin O
prices. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN; O
there O
are O
NO O
MEAT O
dishes B-TARGET
whatsoever. O

The O
seats B-TARGET
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
it O
closes O
early. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-TARGET
bar I-TARGET
and O
has O
great O
staff B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B-TARGET
sizes I-TARGET
are O
appropriate. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant B-TARGET
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates. O

Not O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining. O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-TARGET
. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Fish B-TARGET
is O
so O
very O
fresh. O

Waitstaff B-TARGET
are O
very O
friendly. O

Love O
YUKA B-TARGET
. O

Mermaid B-TARGET
Inn I-TARGET
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
excellent. O

The O
lobster B-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
spaghetti B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Scallops I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Shrimp I-TARGET
is O
great. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
ambience B-TARGET
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
the O
prices. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-TARGET
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high. O

The O
lobster B-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
is O
$24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there, O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect. O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
(I O
had O
a O
halibut B-TARGET
special I-TARGET
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-TARGET
), O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
top-notch. O

When O
my O
dessert O
came, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
special O
occassion O
of O
some O
sort. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-TARGET
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods B-TARGET
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-TARGET
. O

Why? O

They O
don't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer's O
health, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money. O

please O
don't O
fool O
us. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
, O
drunken B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
and O
the O
soupy B-TARGET
dumplings I-TARGET
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-TARGET
fry I-TARGET
blue I-TARGET
crab I-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
nice. O

Of O
course, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares. O

Authentic O
Shanghai O
style O
and O
I O
cannot O
recommend O
a O
better O
Shanghai O
place O
in O
New O
York. O

Have O
frequented O
'ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
remains O
excellent. O

Cheese B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
is O
a O
varied O
delight O
and O
great O
bargain O
at O
$10. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas B-TARGET
, O
paninis B-TARGET
, O
tramezzinis B-TARGET
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating. O

(The O
asparagus, B-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil, I-TARGET
parmesan I-TARGET
bruschetta I-TARGET
is O
a O
winner!) O

Wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over-priced. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
seasonal, O
and O
always O
delicious, O
specials B-TARGET
. O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite. O

I O
loved O
this O
place B-TARGET
!! O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
a O
great O
deal, O
and O
the O
place B-TARGET
its O
self O
was O
great. O

The O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
very O
freindly, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-TARGET
Noir I-TARGET
dont O
get O
me O
wrong, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-TARGET
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
terrible, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing. O

After O
dinner O
the O
manager B-TARGET
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend, O
asked O
him: O
Where O
are O
you O
from...maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
America...and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on. O

We O
did O
tip, O
I O
guess O
the O
model/ O
waitress B-TARGET
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe B-TARGET
Noir I-TARGET
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-TARGET
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place. O

Pizza B-TARGET
here O
is O
consistently O
good. O

Salads B-TARGET
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal. O

You O
should O
pass O
on O
the O
calamari B-TARGET
. O

It O
is O
thick O
and O
slightly O
soggy. O

Decor B-TARGET
is O
charming. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
average. O

What O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
. O

I O
came O
into O
the O
city O
to O
try O
out O
this O
restaurant O
because O
a O
friend O
had O
recommended O
it O
to O
my O
husband. O

The O
ambience B-TARGET
was O
so O
fun, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
really O
tasty. O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes, O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
! O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever. O

A O
gentleman B-TARGET
, O
maybe O
the O
manager, O
came O
to O
our O
table, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order. O

When O
asked O
about O
how O
a O
certain O
dish O
was O
prepared O
in O
comparison O
to O
a O
similar O
at O
other O
thai O
restaurants, O
he O
replied O
this O
is O
not O
Mcdonald's, O
every O
place O
makes O
things O
differently O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude. O

The O
service O
was O
poor, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald's O
than O
this O
joint. O

Never O
again! O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
delicious O
dishes B-TARGET
good O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
NY O
Italian O
Food O
fare O
institutions. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant O
and O
well O
runned O
business O
operation. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
also O
really O
nice. O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8:30. O

Everything O
was O
wonderful; O
food B-TARGET
, O
drinks B-TARGET
, O
staff B-TARGET
, O
mileau B-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-TARGET
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced. O

I O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations, O
but O
both O
times, O
the O
hostess B-TARGET
didn't O
have O
my O
name. O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-TARGET
table I-TARGET
. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
has O
been O
nice, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex B-TARGET
bathroom I-TARGET
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar B-TARGET
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff B-TARGET
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time, O
the O
waitstaff B-TARGET
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar B-TARGET
and O
fantastic O
service B-TARGET
. O

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

Fresh O
ingredients B-TARGET
and O
everything O
is O
made O
to O
order. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken. O

Friendly O
staff B-TARGET
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal O
and O
the O
company O
you're O
with. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-TARGET
to O
be O
outstanding, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
I O
had. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-TARGET
Mojito I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-TARGET
sum I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
good...not O
outstanding, O
but O
good. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-TARGET
patio I-TARGET
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
hear O
well O
there. O

Overall, O
excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
! O

i O
went O
to O
utsav O
about O
a O
yr O
ago O
with O
my O
family. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
nice O
and O
calm. O

but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
slow. O

I O
work O
around O
the O
corner O
and O
tried O
it O
with O
a O
colleague O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

The O
buffet B-TARGET
had O
a O
nice O
selection. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes B-TARGET
. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

I O
would O
go O
back. O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-TARGET
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries B-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy's O
for O
that, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-TARGET
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
huge! O

But, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun. O

Consequently, O
their O
burgers B-TARGET
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them. O

Also O
they O
were O
$15 O
each! O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
pastrami B-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
. O

It O
was O
$14 O
not O
really O
bad O
for O
a O
pound O
of O
Pastrami-but O
it O
didn't O
have O
much O
taste-I've O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere! O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant, O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-TARGET
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it, O
and O
the O
spice B-TARGET
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish. O

And O
the O
Tom B-TARGET
Kha I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
was O
pathetic. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-TARGET
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go. O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
pesto B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
thin-crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy B-TARGET
Italian I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
that O
I'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before. O

Conveniently O
located O
too, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave. O

THe O
back B-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
sitting I-TARGET
area I-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
where O
you O
can O
see O
their O
personal O
herb O
garden. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC. O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more, O
the O
portion B-TARGET
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-TARGET
fries I-TARGET
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-TARGET
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
was O
wonderful. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis B-TARGET
that O
were O
just O
right. O

We O
will O
be O
back. O

love O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

it's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-TARGET
comfort I-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order. O

and O
you O
can't O
beat O
the O
prices. O

highly O
recommended. O

I've O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place B-TARGET
has O
it O
all. O

Great O
food B-TARGET
, O
good O
size O
menu B-TARGET
, O
great O
service B-TARGET
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting B-TARGET
. O

The O
dishes B-TARGET
offered O
were O
unique, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb B-TARGET
sausages I-TARGET
, O
sardines B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
biscuits I-TARGET
, O
large B-TARGET
whole I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-TARGET
ice I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
(the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I've O
ever O
had). O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best. O

The O
freshest, O
best O
variety, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-TARGET
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive. O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost O
and O
a O
great O
deal. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included: O
ceviche B-TARGET
mix I-TARGET
(special) I-TARGET
, O
crab B-TARGET
dumplings I-TARGET
, O
assorted B-TARGET
sashimi I-TARGET
, O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake B-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
banana B-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
. O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-TARGET
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date. O

Average O
to O
good O
Thai B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
, O
but O
terrible O
delivery B-TARGET
. O

I've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice. O

A O
Thai B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
out O
of O
rice O
during O
dinner? O

The O
food B-TARGET
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
I O
called, O
cold O
and O
soggy. O

i O
actually O
feel O
like O
i O
should O
keep O
it O
a O
secret. O

This O
is O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
on O
all O
stand O
points O
especially O
value O
ofr O
money. O

An O
excellent O
service B-TARGET

Went O
to O
Cafe O
Spice O
with O
4 O
of O
my O
friends O
on O
a O
saturday O
night. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial. O

She O
was O
very O
helpful O
in O
suggesting O
us O
drinks O
and O
helped O
us O
in O
ordering O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
dishes B-TARGET
since O
we O
knew O
nothing O
about O
Indian O
food. O

We O
were O
fast O
to O
order O
the O
appetizer O
platter O
since O
we O
were O
very O
hungry. O

The O
food B-TARGET
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab B-TARGET
Jamun I-TARGET
(dessert) I-TARGET
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter. O

I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
who O
recommended O
me O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
will O
certainly O
recommend O
it O
to O
others. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim, O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table. O

Service B-TARGET
here O
was O
great, O
food B-TARGET
was O
fantastic. O

Guacamole+shrimp B-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
was O
really O
great, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-TARGET
, O
very O
good, O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O
frites B-TARGET
that O
came O
with, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared. O

Will O
absolutely O
visit O
again. O

Maybe O
tomorrow O
;-) O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
outstanding O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
quick, O
friendly O
and O
very O
professional. O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd B-TARGET
, O
but O
never O
loud. O

Go O
here. O

Good O
for O
dates O
or O
with O
friends. O

I O
am O
reluctant O
to O
write O
because O
I O
would O
not O
want O
my O
jem O
of O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
to O
become O
overcrowded. O

However, O
it O
is O
jus O
too O
good O
to O
not O
praise O
it. O

By O
far, O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
in O
Manhattan. O

The O
crust B-TARGET
is O
thin, O
the O
ingredients B-TARGET
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
friendly. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City, O
I O
say, O
good O
- O
stay O
out. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me! O

We O
arrived O
on O
time O
for O
our O
reservation O
and O
seated O
promptly. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
really,really O
fresh. O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish. O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
New O
York. O

I O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great O
pizzeria B-TARGET
as O
I O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood. O

All O
of O
the O
pizzas B-TARGET
are O
terrific O
and O
the O
price O
is O
even O
better! O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
. O

It's O
to O
die O
for! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-TARGET
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
the O
money O
and O
said, O
okay, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting! O

We O
weren't O
even O
at O
our O
table O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
total. O

As O
we O
were O
leaving, O
the O
couple O
standing O
by O
the O
door O
said O
to O
another O
waiter, O
we're O
not O
in O
a O
hurry. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet. O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary! O

For O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great O
food B-TARGET
plus O
great O
service B-TARGET
, O
Roxy O
is O
a O
place O
to O
AVOID! O

I've O
been O
here O
twice O
now. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
outstanding, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland. O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho. O

The O
blond B-TARGET
wood I-TARGET
decor I-TARGET
is O
very O
soothing, O
the O
premium B-TARGET
sake I-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Mizu B-TARGET
is O
the O
Japenese O
find O
in O
Grammercy. O

While O
their O
kitchen B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
is O
delicious, O
their O
Sushi B-TARGET
is O
out O
of O
this O
world. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls B-TARGET
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine B-TARGET
the O
best O
around, O
the O
service B-TARGET
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming. O

Warning: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu B-TARGET
! O

Thalia B-TARGET
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people B-TARGET
serving O
you, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
roe I-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor. O

The O
entree B-TARGET
was O
bland O
and O
small, O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
not O
inspired. O

I O
expected O
quite O
a O
bit O
more O
from O
such O
an O
expensive O
menu B-TARGET
. O

The O
view B-TARGET
is O
spectacular, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Wonderful O
strawberry B-TARGET
daiquiries I-TARGET
as O
well! O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City! O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan. O

Authentic O
Taiwanese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
that's O
cheap... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for? O

(Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city). O

The O
cold B-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan. O

delicious O
simple O
food B-TARGET
in O
nice O
outdoor B-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
. O

Kind, O
attentive O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
. O

I O
really O
like O
both O
the O
scallops B-TARGET
and O
the O
mahi B-TARGET
mahi I-TARGET
(on I-TARGET
saffron I-TARGET
risotto I-TARGET
-yum!). O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mashed I-TARGET
potatos I-TARGET
. O

Delicious O
crab B-TARGET
cakes I-TARGET
too. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-TARGET
wasn't O
this O
good, O
the O
garden B-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint B-TARGET
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
with O
good O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
thin I-TARGET
crust I-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
including O
the O
Basil B-TARGET
slice I-TARGET
. O

Their O
calzones B-TARGET
are O
horrific, O
bad, O
vomit-inducing, O
YUCK. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone. O

The O
counter B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
bad. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time. O

They're O
rude O
at O
times, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly. O

NO O
PIZZA B-TARGET
33 I-TARGET
for O
me! O

Anybody O
who O
likes O
this O
place O
must O
be O
from O
a O
different O
planet, O
where O
greasy, O
dry O
and O
tasteless O
are O
complimentary. O

The O
dosas B-TARGET
are O
skimpy, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease, O
and O
personally O
I'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these. O

The O
sandwiches B-TARGET
are O
dry, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced. O

Calling O
the O
place B-TARGET
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room B-TARGET
with O
unhelpful O
clerks B-TARGET
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too. O

Seriously, O
this O
place B-TARGET
kicks O
ass. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
unheralded, O
the O
service B-TARGET
impecible, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
magnificant. O

Best O
Italian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
I O
ever O
had O
(and O
being O
Italian, O
that O
means O
alot). O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely, O
peaceful O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat O
outside. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty. O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it's O
on, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
delicious. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
take O
out-of-towners, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset. O

Great O
sushi B-TARGET
experience. O

Nice O
value. O

Unique O
apppetizers B-TARGET
. O

Try O
sushimi B-TARGET
cucumber I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
. O

Good O
spreads B-TARGET
, O
great O
beverage B-TARGET
selections I-TARGET
and O
bagels B-TARGET
really O
tasty. O

THE O
BIG O
COMPLAINT: O
NO O
TOASTING O
AVAILABLE. O

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel O
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted. O

Murray O
won't O
do O
it. O

Won't O
or O
Can't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service O
directory. O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service B-TARGET
. O

So O
close, O
but O
not O
good O
enough. O

Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
awful. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices. O

Also, O
don't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll, O
if O
it's O
not O
on O
the O
menu, O
you O
can't O
have O
it. O

Love O
Pizza B-TARGET
33 I-TARGET
.. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing... O
their O
Pizza B-TARGET
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

This O
tiny O
Williamsburg B-TARGET
spot I-TARGET
is O
always O
pleasantly O
surprising. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor B-TARGET
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC. O

Even O
the O
pasta O
is O
delicious O
here O
(a O
rarity O
in O
New O
York O
pizza O
restaurants). O

I've O
been O
many O
time O
and O
have O
never O
been O
disappointed. O

Compared O
to O
Ess-a, O
Tal O
offers O
a O
less O
doughy O
bagel! O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
(for O
those O
on O
a O
diet) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little. O

The O
cream B-TARGET
cheeses I-TARGET
are O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
I O
love O
that O
coffee B-TARGET
!! O

A O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O
line O
really O
fast! O

A O
little O
pricey O
but O
it O
really O
hits O
the O
spot O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning! O

Bagels B-TARGET
are O
ok, O
but O
be O
sure O
not O
to O
make O
any O
special O
requests! O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager B-TARGET
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere! O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-TARGET
!.. O

the O
turkey B-TARGET
burgers I-TARGET
are O
scary! O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
I've O
ever O
encountered. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
udon I-TARGET
was O
soy O
sauce O
and O
water. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
awful! O

The O
rice B-TARGET
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard. O

Furthermore, O
the O
rice B-TARGET
had O
no O
seasoning, O
so O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
bland O
and O
disgusting. O

The O
fish B-TARGET
was O
adequate, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
. O

Good, O
fast O
service B-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend. O

Food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
inexpensive. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
perfect. O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy. O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience. O

Jimmy O
is O
Dominican! O

Well, O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
music B-TARGET
blasted O
and O
the O
system O
isnt O
that O
great O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
at O
least O
100 O
dollar O
bottle B-TARGET
minimun I-TARGET
then O
you'll O
love O
it O
here. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there. O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed. O

That O
place O
was O
awesome,,, O
sally O
! O

Awsome O
Pizza B-TARGET
especially O
the O
Margheritta B-TARGET
slice I-TARGET
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving. O

Great O
atmoshere B-TARGET
and O
worth O
every O
bit. O

Open O
late O
(well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O
there O
and O
I'm O
a O
night O
person) O

Winnie B-TARGET
and O
her O
staff B-TARGET
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for? O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
(except O
for O
my O
mom's O
of O
course). O

Try O
the O
Pad B-TARGET
Thai I-TARGET
, O
or O
sample O
anything O
on O
the O
appetizer B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
...they're O
all O
delicious. O

Everything O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
special. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
yet O
discreet. O

The O
flavors O
robust O
and O
subtle. O

The O
brioche B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lollies I-TARGET
as O
party O
favors O
is O
a O
cute O
and O
sweet O
touch O
to O
a O
most O
memorable O
meal. O

I'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date. O

The O
place B-TARGET
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
food B-TARGET
is O
wonderful. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-TARGET
and O
crab B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
(they O
are O
all O
good) O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot B-TARGET
for O
snacks O
and O
chat. O

As O
a O
retired O
hipster, O
I O
can O
say O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
certainty O
that O
for O
the O
last O
year O
Lucky B-TARGET
Strike I-TARGET
has O
been O
the O
best O
laid-back O
late O
night O
in O
the O
city. O

The O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
fun, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
gorgeous O
(in O
the O
wonderful O
aesthetic O
beautification O
way, O
not O
in O
that O
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* O
way). O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
yummy, O
especially O
their O
cooked-to-perfection O
mussels B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
spicy I-TARGET
tomato I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
and O
their O
shoestring O
crispy O
fries B-TARGET
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late B-TARGET
night I-TARGET
atmosphere I-TARGET
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O
martini B-TARGET
in O
a O
glass O
(that's O
about O
2 O
1/2 O
drinks) O
for O
$8.50 O
(I O
recommend O
the O
Vanilla B-TARGET
Shanty I-TARGET
, O
mmmm!) O
in O
a O
great O
homey O
setting B-TARGET
with O
great O
music B-TARGET
. O

The O
in-house B-TARGET
lady I-TARGET
DJ I-TARGET
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music, O
and O
moreover, O
takes O
requests. O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

Suan B-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
(classmates) O
too. O

Its O
location B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-TARGET
again O
and O
again. O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai B-TARGET

noodles B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
coconut I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
is O
the O
MUST! O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-TARGET
soon! O

In O
summer-eat O
outside O
on O
a O
terrace B-TARGET
(another O
great O
feature O
of O
Suan)!!! O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-TARGET
working O
in O
a O
restaurant. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
in O
all O
of O
the O
city. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
you O
not O
rushing O
out O
to O
eat O
there. O

This O
restaurant O
used O
to O
be O
our O
regular O
Thursday O
night O
dinner O
location. O

During O
the O
course O
of O
the O
past O
3 O
months, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
and O
staff B-TARGET
changed O
and O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
better. O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before. O

The O
food B-TARGET
now O
is O
inconsistent. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-TARGET
you'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret. O

The O
setting B-TARGET
is O
casual O
and O
romantic. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
excellent! O

if O
you're O
daring, O
try O
the O
balsamic B-TARGET
vinegar I-TARGET
over I-TARGET
icecream I-TARGET
, O
it's O
wonderful! O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go B-TARGET
Go I-TARGET
Hamburgers I-TARGET
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
($8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-TARGET
sum I-TARGET
, O
though O
pricey O
by O
Chinatown O
standards, O
is O
worth O
it. O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table. O

The O
wait B-TARGET
here O
is O
long O
for O
dim O
sum, O
but O
if O
you O
don't O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
not O
your O
gig, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
(for O
Chinatown) O
alternative. O

A O
few O
tips: O
skip O
the O
turnip B-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
, O
roast B-TARGET
pork I-TARGET
buns I-TARGET
and O
egg B-TARGET
custards I-TARGET
. O

These O
are O
overpriced O
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner: O

(1) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
Mott O
St. O
just O
south O
of O
bayard O

(2) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal. O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
exceptional. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special, O
the O
braised B-TARGET
lamb I-TARGET
shank I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
excellent. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
friendly O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
casual. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal B-TARGET

this O
little O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-TARGET
decor I-TARGET
and O
affordable O
city O
prices. O

the O
pad B-TARGET
se I-TARGET
ew I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
however O
the O
pad B-TARGET
thai I-TARGET
was O
far O
too O
oily. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time. O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger B-TARGET
House I-TARGET
several O
times, O
and O
it's O
always O
good. O

The O
fried B-TARGET
dumplings I-TARGET
are O
GREAT! O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
! O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event, O
especially O
a O
small, O
intimate O
one, O
forget O
about O
it. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile! O

Nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything. O

Terrible, O
terrible O
management B-TARGET
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down. O

Never O
fails O
to O
please. O

delicious O
bagels B-TARGET
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven. O

Spreads B-TARGET
and O
toppings B-TARGET
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
fast O
and O
friendly. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel, O
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel. O

But O
that O
is O
highly O
forgivable. O

Been O
there, O
done O
that, O
and O
New O
York, O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
decent O
at O
best, O
and O
the O
ambience B-TARGET
, O
well, O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying. O

If O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you'll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype. O

Rao B-TARGET
is O
a O
good O
restaurant, O
but O
it's O
nothing O
special. O

I've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants. O

But O
after O
last O
night, O
Spice O
Grill O
is O
the O
only O
place O
I'm O
eating O
indian B-TARGET
cuisine I-TARGET
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp B-TARGET
appetizers I-TARGET
. O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
the O
correct O
ambience B-TARGET
and O
an O
excellent O
staff B-TARGET
to O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
a O
guest O
and O
a O
friend O
at O
the O
same O
time. O

Great O
food B-TARGET
, O
great O
prices, O
great O
service B-TARGET
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality, O
cheap O
eats B-TARGET
- O
this O
is O
the O
place. O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff B-TARGET
gives O
to O
the O
food. O

also O
it's O
great O
to O
have O
dinner O
in O
a O
very O
romantic O
and O
confortable O
place B-TARGET
, O
the O
service B-TARGET
it's O
just O
perfect...they're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O
to O
live O
the O
place! O

I O
love O
Ess-a-bagel, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray's O
for O
convenience. O

Their O
bagels B-TARGET
are O
fine, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special' O
bagel O
experience. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for, O
in O
my O
opinion. O

Also O
a O
little O
more O
expensive O
than O
your O
average O
bagel O
place. O

Great O
bagels B-TARGET
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way. O

The O
appetizing O
is O
excellent O
- O
just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O
Barney O
Greengrass O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
(if O
bought O
by O
the O
pound). O

Drawbacks: O
service B-TARGET
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don't O
toast! O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
absolutely O
amazing!! O

The O
baked B-TARGET
clams I-TARGET
octopus I-TARGET
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we've O
ever O
had!! O

The O
lamb B-TARGET
was O
tender O
so O
full O
of O
flavor, O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
was O
divine!! O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
attentive. O

The O
place B-TARGET
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar B-TARGET
scene I-TARGET
seems O
to O
be O
happening. O

Dessert B-TARGET
is O
a O
joke...dont O
bother O

Volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars, O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
can't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
this O
friendly. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
Family O
feel B-TARGET
, O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions B-TARGET
which O
are O
enormous; O
the O
veal B-TARGET
alone O
could O
have O
single-handedly O
solved O
third O
world O
famine. O

The O
anti-pasta B-TARGET
was O
excellent, O
especially O
the O
calamari B-TARGET
, O
as O
were O
the O
filling O
pasta B-TARGET
mains I-TARGET

The O

list I-TARGET
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal B-TARGET
. O

Still, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off-set O
by O
the O
pour-your-own O
measures B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
liquers I-TARGET
which O
were O

Fantastic O
place B-TARGET

Cute O

A O
pleasant O

Go O
there O

relax O
and O
feel O

Lucky B-TARGET

is O
a O
great O

just O
grab O
a O

eat. O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously, O
but O
it O
shouldn't. O

Great O

great O

great O

I O
recommend O
it! O

Just O
ignore O
the O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-TARGET
for O
meeting O
friends, O
having O
lunch, O
dinner, O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O
drinks! O

(Always O
ask O
the O

for O
the O
SEASONAL B-TARGET

Guaranteed O
to O
be O
a O
tasty O

that O
you O

all O
of O
the O
above O
at O
the O
Heartland B-TARGET
Brewery I-TARGET
for O
over O
5 O
years O
now O
and O
I O
HAVE O

All O

What O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
! O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

A O
cool O
bar B-TARGET
with O
great O
food B-TARGET
, O
and O
tons O
of O
excellent O
beer B-TARGET
. O

And O
even O
with O
it's O
Pub O
atmosphere O
they O
were O
great O
to O
my O
kids O
too! O

Loved O
it! O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best. O

The O
shrimp B-TARGET
scampi I-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
antipasti B-TARGET
were O
plentiful. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant, O
drive O
to O
Corona B-TARGET
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-TARGET
(which O
is O
exceptional) O
is O
the O
service B-TARGET
. O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
don't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-TARGET
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food B-TARGET
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage. O

The O
porcini B-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
special I-TARGET
was O
tasteless, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
tagliatelle I-TARGET
. O

A O
real O
dissapointment. O

But O
that O
wasn't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake: O
a O
tiramisu B-TARGET
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies. O

Priced O
at O
upper O
intermediate O
range. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good, O
and O
I'm O
a O
eater. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O
style O
BBQ B-TARGET
ribs I-TARGET
in O
the O
city. O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
rice B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
or O
the O
different O
varieties O
of O
congee B-TARGET
(rice I-TARGET
porridge) I-TARGET
. O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend. O

It's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone. O

However, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food B-TARGET
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor B-TARGET
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
this O
place. O

Quick O
and O
friendly O
service B-TARGET
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city. O

It's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy. O

When O
I'm O
feeling O
stressed O
by O
the O
noise O
and O
congestion O
around O
my O
office, O
I O
head O
for O
Cafe O
St. O
Bart's. O

When O
you're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-TARGET
dining I-TARGET
room I-TARGET
(which O
has O
a O
spectacular, O
hand-painted O
high O
ceiling B-TARGET
) O
you'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
wonderful, O
tasty O
and O
filling, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
professional O
and O
friendly. O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio B-TARGET
. O

Ahhh... O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan B-TARGET
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great. O

This O
little O
place B-TARGET
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TARGET
for O
your O
money. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood. O

They O
all O
know O
you. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
. O

Good O
drink B-TARGET
. O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home? O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake B-TARGET
like O
this. O

I O
thought O
I O
had O
died O
and O
gone O
to O
heaven. O

Great O
spot B-TARGET
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner. O

Warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor B-TARGET
seating I-TARGET
in O
the O
warmer O
months. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wines I-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

Have O
been O
several O
times O
and O
it O
never O
dissapoints. O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis, O
we O
decided O
to O
try. O

We O
were O
less O
than O
impressed. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
were O
great, O
the O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better. O

We O
ordered O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
casserole I-TARGET
, O
but O
what O
we O
got O
were O
a O
few O
small O
pieces O
of O
chicken, O
all O
dark O
meat O
and O
on O
the O
bone. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again... O

i've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
if O
not O
good. O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
, O
beef B-TARGET
, O
and O
lamb B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
. O

i O
don't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
can't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian. O

service B-TARGET
is O
friendly, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations O
on O
weekends O
though. O

skip O
dessert B-TARGET
. O

Best O
Reuben B-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
ever! O

A O
classic! O

Don't O
miss O
Bloom's B-TARGET
on O
your O
next O
trip O
to O
Manhatten. O

It O
was O
the O
first O
place O
we O
ate O
on O
our O
first O
trip O
to O
New O
York, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
place B-TARGET
we O
stop O
as O
we O
head O
out O
of O
town O
on O
our O
next O
trip O
to O
New O
York. O

Thanks O
Bloom's B-TARGET
for O
a O
lovely O
trip. O

As O
a O
fan O
of O
Thai, O
I O
have O
tried O
quite O
a O
few O
different O
restaurants O
in O
NYC O
and O
this O
one O
was O
definitely O
the O
worst. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
fresh, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily. O

It O
just O
wasn't O
Thai. O

Went O
to O
Ottimo O
and O
was O
expecting O
outstanding O
pizza O
(as O
I O
love O
La O
Pizza O
Fresca). O

Was O
surprisingly O
disappointed. O

Pizza B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
soggy. O

Ravioli B-TARGET
was O
good...but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced. O

Not O
enough O
wines B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
either. O

Service B-TARGET
, O
however, O
was O
excellent...and O
I O
liked O
the O
setting/atmosphere B-TARGET
a O
lot. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
just O
average...if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
bargain. O

Authentic O
Pakistani B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

People B-TARGET
are O
always O
friendly. O

Don't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor B-TARGET
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap, O
good O
food B-TARGET
. O

Faan B-TARGET
is O
sooo O
good. O

The O
best O
pad B-TARGET
thai I-TARGET
i've O
ever O
had. O

The O
design B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
just O
as O
good. O

bottles B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
are O
cheap O
and O
good. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want? O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
actually O
aweful. O

I'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross. O

The O
mussles B-TARGET
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I've O
ever O
tasted, O
the O
seabass B-TARGET
was O
bland, O
the O
goat B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese, O
the O
penne B-TARGET
w/ I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
had O
bones O
in O
it... O
It O
was O
disgusting. O

Nice O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O
desert B-TARGET
was O
good. O

Wouldn't O
recomend O
it O
for O
dinner! O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
date O
spot O
for O
Williamsburg O
couples. O

The O
jukebox B-TARGET
plays O
everything O
from O
Italian O
Opera O
to O
The O
Strokes. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
amazing, O
rich O
pastas B-TARGET
and O
fresh O
doughy O
pizza B-TARGET
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-TARGET
, O
the O
owner B-TARGET
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
fast. O

If O
only O
they O
delivered, O
they'd O
make O
a O
mint! O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks B-TARGET
! O

esp. O
during O
happy O
hour! O

enough O
said! O

the O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
amazing O
and O
half O
off O
till O
8pm. O

Ask O
for O
Usha B-TARGET
, O
the O
nicest O
bartender O
in O
manhattan. O

My O
fav O
was O
the O
sassy B-TARGET
lassi I-TARGET
... O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
place O
to O
try O
some O
roti B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
. O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B-TARGET
(Egg) I-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
. O

Delicate O
spices B-TARGET
, O
onions B-TARGET
, O
eggs B-TARGET
and O
a O
kick-ass O
roti B-TARGET
. O

Amazing! O

Toons B-TARGET
has O
recently O
been O
redone, O
so O
it's O
now O
a O
very O
attractive O
space. O

The O
food B-TARGET
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever. O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots. O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor B-TARGET
, O
good O
service B-TARGET
, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
surprisingly O
excellent. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
HUGE, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
(rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person) O
for O
two O
people. O

Among O
all O
of O
the O
new O
5th O
avenue O
restaurants, O
this O
offers O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
best O
values O
for O
your O
money. O

Can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back. O

Best O
drumsticks B-TARGET
over I-TARGET
rice I-TARGET
and O
sour B-TARGET
spicy I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
in O
town! O

Beef B-TARGET
noodle I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
is O
good O
as O
well. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant B-TARGET
is O
clean. O

Best O
Taiwanese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
in O
NY! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao's B-TARGET
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it. O

Rao's O
has O
the O
best O
service B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
NYC. O

Good O
luck O
getting O
a O
table. O

My O
roommate O
and O
I O
LOVE O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location, O
and O
to O
our O
delight, O
they O
have O
outdoor B-TARGET
seating I-TARGET
, O
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me. O

Indoor B-TARGET
was O
very O
cozy O
and O
cute. O

The O
portion B-TARGET
sizes O
here O
are O
huge, O
and O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
is O
good. O

While O
it's O
not O
Nobu, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full. O

Staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
accomodating. O

Excellent O
dumplings B-TARGET
served O
amid O
clean, O
chic O
decor B-TARGET
. O

I O
got O
the O
$10 B-TARGET
10-piece I-TARGET
dim I-TARGET
sum I-TARGET
combo I-TARGET
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great. O

But O
$1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece??? O

Not O
worth O
it. O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-TARGET
lasagna I-TARGET
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
pudding I-TARGET
for O
dessert. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again. O

Great O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
incredible. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs. O

When O
family O
came O
in O
he O
gave O
them O
apps O
to O
test O
their O
palets, O
and O
then O
ordered O
for O
them. O

Everyone O
was O
more O
then O
happy O
with O
his O
choices. O

Great O
food B-TARGET
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable. O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O
Prosperity. O

The O
food B-TARGET
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
(Cantonese O
that O
is...). O

I O
fell O
in O
love O
with O
the O
egg B-TARGET
noodles I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
beef I-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
dumplings I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
slices I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
BBQ I-TARGET
roast I-TARGET
pork I-TARGET
. O

This O
dish B-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it. O

Try O
the O
congee B-TARGET
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow B-TARGET
Ley I-TARGET
Soh I-TARGET
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread. O

Simply O
some O
good O
tasting O
Chinese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
at O
incredible O
prices... O

Service B-TARGET
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for... O

Just O
make O
sure O
my O
ice O
water O
is O
kept O
full O
and O
my O
tea O
kettle O
filled O
with O
piping O
hot O
tea O
and O
that's O
all O
the O
service O
I O
need... O

Big B-TARGET
Wong I-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
and O
fill O
your O
stomach. O

this O
place... O
we O
stumbled O
upon O
it O
on O
labor O
day O
weekend. O

whoever O
the O
jazz B-TARGET
duo I-TARGET
was, O
they O
were O
on O
POINT. O

good O
music B-TARGET
, O
great O
food B-TARGET
, O
speedy O
service B-TARGET
affordable O
prices. O

even O
the O
wine B-TARGET
by I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
glass I-TARGET
was O
good. O

its O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
way O
if O
you O
don't O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood, O
but O
definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
from O
wherever O
you O
are. O

Consistently O
good O
Japanese B-TARGET
Tapas I-TARGET
. O

Same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave. O

Always O
good O
drinks B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
good; O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too... O

A O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks... O

Yakitori B-TARGET
(bbq I-TARGET
meats) I-TARGET
is O
tasty O
too. O

It's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel's O
Share, O
which O
is O
a O
cool, O
more O
romantic O
bar... O

Just O
moved O
to O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
we've O
been O
trying O
all O
the O
West O
Village O
Sushi O
restaurants. O

If O
you O
don't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low O
quality O
fish B-TARGET
, O
unfriendly O
staff B-TARGET
and O
a O
sushi B-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish B-TARGET
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit. O

Wasn't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated...while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef B-TARGET
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing. O

No O
thanks!!! O

This O
place B-TARGET
, O
which O
is O
only O
a O
few O
months O
old, O
is O
perhaps O
Queens' O
biggest O
secret! O

Fabulous O
decor B-TARGET
- O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
a O
trendy O
Manhattan O
restaurant, O
very O
very O
good O
food B-TARGET
, O
cheaply-priced, O
generally O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
, O
and O
if O
you're O
a O
Manhattanite, O
or O
spend O
most O
of O
your O
time O
in O
Manhattan, O
Rice B-TARGET
Avenue I-TARGET
will O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
home.....very O
Soho/Village/Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele.....all O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue! O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date. O

We O
were O
then O
shooed O
inside. O

One O
would O
think O
we'd O
get O
an O
apology O
or O
complimentary O
drinks O
- O
instead, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-TARGET
wouldn't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O
to O
do O
so. O

We O
left, O
never O
to O
return. O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS, O
I O
don't O
need O
overpriced O
food B-TARGET
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait-staff B-TARGET
who O
don't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner, O
clumsy O
service B-TARGET
, O
and O
management B-TARGET
that O
doesn't O
care. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side. O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave. O

Great O
bagels, O
spreads O
and O
a O
good O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
in. O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town. O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre. O

You O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown. O

They're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing, O
Queens. O

Baluchi's B-TARGET
has O
solid O
food B-TARGET
and O
a O
nice O
decor B-TARGET
at O
reasonable O
prices. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-TARGET
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service B-TARGET
and O
has O
no O
personality. O

In O
fact, O
it O
appears O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
postal O
at O
any O
moment. O

Skip O
this O
location O
and O
go O
to O
the O
one O
in O
Soho. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service B-TARGET
! O

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-TARGET
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here. O

$20 O
for O
all B-TARGET
you I-TARGET
can I-TARGET
eat I-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
cannot O
be O
beaten. O

I O
went O
to O
Areo B-TARGET
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
with O
four O
of O
my O
girlfriends, O
and O
spent O
three O
enjoyable O
hours O
there. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
at O
first, O
so O
we O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
before O
we O
were O
seated. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-TARGET
are O
very O
attentive, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20's/30 O
year O
olds O
also. O

The O
vibe B-TARGET
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy, O
service B-TARGET
was O
great O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent! O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
new I-TARGET
york I-TARGET
city I-TARGET
skiline I-TARGET
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window. O

Although O
they O
do O
the O
typical O
what O
kind O
of O
water O
would O
you O
like O
questions O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
overall O
very O
relaxing O
to O
place B-TARGET
to O
eat. O

I've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great. O

Personal B-TARGET
pans I-TARGET
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights. O

I O
heartily O
recommend. O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
-- O
the O
delivery B-TARGET
guys I-TARGET
have O
MAJOR O
attitude. O

Never O
have O
I O
had O
such O
dramatic O
delivery B-TARGET
guys I-TARGET
(a O
lot O
of O
huffing O
and O
panting O
and O
muttering O
under O
breath O
b/c O
I O
live O
in O
a O
walkup) O
who O
always O
seem O
disappointed O
with O
their O
tips. O

Hey, O
I O
think O
$2+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ain't O
bad. O

Love O
the O
scene B-TARGET
first O
off- O
the O
place B-TARGET
has O
a O
character O
and O
nice O
light O
to O
it..very O
fortunate, O
location B-TARGET
wise. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge. O

The O
price O
very O
reasonable. O

We O
were O
4 O
and O
got O
the O
family O
size O
penne B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
la I-TARGET
vodka I-TARGET
which O
was O
tremendously O
gigantic O
portion...a O
bucket O
of O
food O
literally. O

We O
got O
most O
of O
it O
back O
at O
home O
with O
us. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
can't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
penne I-TARGET
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count, O
penne...got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed...lol O

No, O
really. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza O
here. O

La B-TARGET
Rosa I-TARGET
waltzes O
in, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best. O

Interesting O
selection B-TARGET
, O
good O
wines B-TARGET
, O
service B-TARGET
fine, O
fun O
decor B-TARGET
. O

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O
restaurant. O

I O
love O
it. O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-TARGET
to O
warm O
up. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service B-TARGET
with O
a O
smile. O

To O
me O
it O
exemplifies O
Soho, O
cute, O
artsy, O
interesting. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out!!! O

This O
place B-TARGET
blew O
me O
away...by O
far O
my O
new O
favorite O
restaurant O
on O
the O
uppereast O
side. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive. O

LOVE O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
- O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
in O
Paris. O

The O
mussels B-TARGET
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
...definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
great O
staff B-TARGET
at O
La O
Lanterna. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host, O
Vittorio B-TARGET
, O
and O
his O
crew B-TARGET
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family--although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not-so-little O
gem O
does, O
it O
amazing O
he's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not-so-frequent O
visitor. O

I've O
also O
been O
amazed O
at O
all O
the O
new O
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years: O
A O
new O
Jazz B-TARGET
Bar I-TARGET
, O
the O
most O
fantastic O
Dining B-TARGET
Garden I-TARGET
, O
the O
Best O
Thin B-TARGET
Crust I-TARGET
Pizzas I-TARGET
, O
and O
now O
a O
Lasagna B-TARGET
Menu I-TARGET
which O
is O
to O
die O
for O
(these O
are O
not O
your O
average O
lasagnas)! O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-TARGET
! O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
guys! O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O.G. O
again O
last O
night. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-TARGET
here. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings B-TARGET
from O
the O
dumpling O
menu. O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-TARGET
Salmon I-TARGET
, O
Sea B-TARGET
Bass I-TARGET
and O
Crispy B-TARGET
Duck I-TARGET
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake O
but O
isn't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about? O

Love O
Al B-TARGET
Di I-TARGET
La I-TARGET

I O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
everyone. O

Great O
food B-TARGET
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Brooklyn. O

The O
pastas B-TARGET
are O
incredible, O
the O
risottos B-TARGET
(particularly O
the O
sepia B-TARGET
) O
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
braised B-TARGET
rabbit I-TARGET
is O
amazing. O

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

The O
food B-TARGET
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced- O
fish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chips I-TARGET
was O
about O
$15.... O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink..... O
this O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
it... O

Tasty O
Dog B-TARGET
! O

An O
awesome O
organic O
dog B-TARGET
, O
and O
a O
conscious O
eco O
friendly O
establishment B-TARGET
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
hot O
dogs O
I O
have O
ever O
eaten. O

Can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back. O

The O
Cypriot B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
has O
a O
lot O
going O
for O
it. O

But O
the O
best O
pork B-TARGET
souvlaki I-TARGET
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing. O

Trust O
me. O

Run O
don't O
walk. O

Super O
YUMMY O
Pizza B-TARGET

I O
was O
visiting O
New O
York O
City O
with O
a O
friend O

warm O

my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O

it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza! O

We O
had O
fun O
eating O
in O
there, O
we O
were O
there O
like O
around O
3 O
a.m. O
in O
the O
morning! O

Will O
comeback O
for O
sure, O
wish O
they O
have O
it O
here O
in O
LA.. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
, O
although O
the O
interior B-TARGET
could O
use O
some O
help. O

The O
space B-TARGET
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
setting, O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that. O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-TARGET
, O
though O
:) O

Great O
sake B-TARGET

Reliable, O
Fresh O
Sushi B-TARGET

My O

The O
sashimi B-TARGET

fresh O
and O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious. O

Have O
never O
had O

We've O
found O
it O
to O
be O
better O
and O
fresher O
than O
Kiku O
which O
is O
comparable O
in O
price. O

Best. O
Sushi B-TARGET
. O
Ever. O

This O
place O
has O
ruined O
me O
for O
neighborhood O
sushi B-TARGET
. O

Creative, O
consistent, O
fresh. O

Excellent O
sashimi B-TARGET
, O
and O
the O
millennium B-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
is O
beyond O
delicious. O

Not O
cheap O
but O
very O
yummy. O

Love O
it. O

Very, O
very O
nice O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
hidden O
away, O
but O
once O
you O
get O
there, O
it's O
all O
worth O
it. O

not O
only O
is O
the O
food B-TARGET

Loved O
It O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Water's O
Edge O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
attentive, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
views B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
city I-TARGET
were O
great. O

I'd O
definitely O
go O
back O
again. O

Great O
place B-TARGET
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O
atmosphere B-TARGET
that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week. O

Place B-TARGET
is O
open O
till O
late, O
no O
dress O
code. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood B-TARGET
spaghetti I-TARGET
. O

Highly O
recommended! O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
for O
great O
prices O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit. O

The O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
is O
very O
courteous O
and O
accomodating. O

The O
space B-TARGET
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
- O
1 O
hour, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo-chinese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

There O
are O
no O
negatives O
to O
speak O
of. O

the O
bestt! O

my O
favorite O
place B-TARGET
lol O

i O
love O
their O
chicken B-TARGET
pasta I-TARGET
cant O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

its O
alright O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B-TARGET
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces. O

lobster B-TARGET
was O
good, O
nothing O
spectacular. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt B-TARGET
. O

Way O
below O
average O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

I O
love O
this O
place B-TARGET

I O
wasn't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
can't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
quick O
and O
friendly. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
nice O
and O
clean. O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello B-TARGET
alla I-TARGET
marsala I-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed. O

The O
veal B-TARGET
and O
the O
mushrooms B-TARGET
were O
cooked O
perfectly. O

The O
potato B-TARGET
balls I-TARGET
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery. O

The O
only O
downside... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time. O

I'll O
be O
back O
for O
sure. O

WORST O
PLACE B-TARGET
ON O
SMITH O
STREET O
IN O
BROOKLYN O

Very O
immature O
bartender B-TARGET
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks, O
service B-TARGET
was O
so O
slowwwww, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm, O
waitresses B-TARGET
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers. O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
to O
anybody O
even O
for O
a O
casual O
dinner. O

awesome O

the O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
fresh O
... O

overpriced O
japanese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
with O
mediocre O
service B-TARGET

Went O
here O
on O
sat O
1/26 O
and O
was O
disappointed. O

Chicken B-TARGET
teriyaki I-TARGET
had O
tomato O
or O
pimentos O
on O
top?? O

food B-TARGET
was O
luke O
warm. O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all. O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert B-TARGET
and O
they O
dont O
have. O

Too O
many O
other O
good O
places O
to O
have O
to O
settle. O

Not O
because O
you O
are O
" O
The B-TARGET
Four I-TARGET
Seasons I-TARGET
"... O
– O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
charge O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
for O
a O
romatic O
dinner. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service B-TARGET
, O
however, O
I O
left O
The B-TARGET
Four I-TARGET
Seasons I-TARGET
very O
dissappointed. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
dinner B-TARGET
in O
Manhattan O
should O
cost O
$400.00 O
where O
I O
am O
not O
swept O
off O
my O
feet. O

Red B-TARGET
Dragon I-TARGET
Roll I-TARGET
- O
my O
favorite O
thing O
to O
eat, O
of O
any O
food O
group O
- O
hands O
down O

Just O
go O
to O
Yamato B-TARGET
and O
order O
the O
Red B-TARGET
Dragon I-TARGET
Roll I-TARGET
. O

If O
you O
don't O
like O
it, O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you. O

The O
Seafood B-TARGET
Dynamite I-TARGET
is O
also O
otherworldly. O

I'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself. O

Favorite O
Sushi B-TARGET
in O
NYC O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
some O
of O
the O
'best' O
sushi O
joints O
in O
NYC O
(Nobu, O
Bond O
Street, O
JewelBako, O
etc) O
and O
Yamato O
is O
my O
favorite. O

An O
unpretentious O
spot B-TARGET
in O
Park O
Slope, O
the O
sushi B-TARGET
is O
consistently O
good, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
effective O
and O
unassuming. O

In O
the O
summer O
months, O
the O
back B-TARGET
garden I-TARGET
area I-TARGET
is O
really O
nice. O

The O
rolls B-TARGET
are O
creative O
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
another O
sushi O
place O
that O
serves O
up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O
japanese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

The O
Dancing, B-TARGET
White I-TARGET
River I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Millenium I-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
are O
musts. O

SO O
GOOD O

I O
CAN O
EAT O
HERE O
EVERY O
DAY O
OF O
THE O
WEEK O
REALLY O
LOL O
LOVE O
THIS O
PLACE B-TARGET
...) O

Gross O
food B-TARGET
– O
Wow- O

I O
can't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food B-TARGET
in O
New O
York. O

My O
quesadilla B-TARGET
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor. O

And O
$11 O
for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole B-TARGET
? O

Come O
on. O

Don't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
margaritas B-TARGET
, O
either. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila. O

Really, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds--this, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one. O

Save O
your O
money O
and O
your O
time O
and O
go O
somewhere O
else. O

Oh, O
and O
I O
never O
write O
reviews--I O
just O
was O
so O
moved O
by O
how O
bad O
this O
place B-TARGET
was, O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
my O
duty O
to O
spread O
the O
word. O

Great O
Indian B-TARGET
Food I-TARGET
! O

This O
place O
was O
reccomended O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
good, O
the O
place B-TARGET
was O
clean O
and O
affordable. O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
! O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
spot, O
very O
relaxing O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
all O
the O
times O
, O
celebrated O
my O
engagement O
and O
my O
wedding O

very O
well O

The O

recommend O
this O
beautiful O
place B-TARGET

Nice O
for O
one O
time O
special O
occasion. O

Went O
for O
Mom's O
birthday O
brunch/lunch. O

They O
honored O
reservation O
on O
Sunday O
afternoon O
very O
well. O

Be O
aware. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss B-TARGET
bottles I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
were O
$8 O
a O
piece. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
OK. O

Nice O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
river I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
NYC I-TARGET
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband. O

Remind O
me O
of O
home. O

Great O
survice B-TARGET

MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm O
so O
delicious O

A O
beautifully O
designed O
dreamy O
Egyptian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
that O
gets O
sceney O
at O
night. O

Watch O
the O
talented O
belly B-TARGET
dancers I-TARGET
as O
you O
enjoy O
delicious O
baba B-TARGET
ganoush I-TARGET
that's O
more O
lemony O
than O
smoky. O

Oh, O
and O
there's O
hookah B-TARGET
. O

Raymond B-TARGET
the O
bartender O
rocks! O

Pacifico B-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
casually O
hang O
out. O

The O
drinks B-TARGET
are O
great, O
especially O
when O
made O
by O
Raymond B-TARGET
. O

The O
omlette B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
brunch I-TARGET
is O
great... O

the O
spinach B-TARGET
is O
fresh, O
definately O
not O
frozen... O

quacamole B-TARGET
at O
pacifico O
is O
yummy, O
as O
are O
the O
wings B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chimmichuri I-TARGET
. O

A O
weakness O
is O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
salads I-TARGET
. O

It's O
just O
average, O
just O
shredded, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it. O

Also, O
I O
personally O
wasn't O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
portobello B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
asparagus I-TARGET
mole I-TARGET
. O

Overall, O
decent O
food B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
price, O
with O
friendly O
people B-TARGET
. O

Best O
Indian B-TARGET
Restaurant I-TARGET
in O
the O
City O

Decor B-TARGET
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
amazing! O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros B-TARGET
in O
New O
York. O

Small, O
bright, O
and O
clean, O
BZ O
Grill O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints, O
both O
in O
Astoria O
and O
out. O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food B-TARGET
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices, O
and O
all O
made O
in-house O
(even O
the O
gyro B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
and O
sausages B-TARGET
), O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
ingredients B-TARGET
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected. O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Cypriot I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
are O
excellent, O
but O
the O
gyro B-TARGET
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come--if O
you O
don't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted. O

Best O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
Brooklyn O

The O
best! O

Great O
food B-TARGET
, O
amazing O
service B-TARGET
, O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
class O
act. O

The O
veal B-TARGET
was O
incredible O
last O
night. O

Fresh, O
mind O
blowing O
flavors. O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
must O
visit! O

You O
want O
to O
have O
a O
real O
hot O
dog O
in O
Brooklyn? O

Skip O
Nathan's...you O
can O
get O
that O

to O
Bark. O

Delicious, O
creative O
and O

Every O
time O
I O
have O
a O
special O
occasion O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
going O
anywhere O
else. O

It O
is O
so O
romantic. O

Its O
dark, O
and O
cozy.. O
there O
is O
always O
jazz O
music O
playing O
when O
we O
go. O

Most O
of O
the O
booths B-TARGET
allow O
you O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
eachother O
without O
looking O
like O
'that' O
couple. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
all O
shared O
so O
we O
get O
to O
order O
together O
and O
eat O
together. O

I've O
enjoyed O
99% O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
we've O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too-authentic-for-me O
dish B-TARGET
(I'm O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring). O

Once O
you O
try O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
beware.. O
you O
can't O
stop! O

You'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary, O
birthday, O
valentines O
day... O

For O
a O
Fabulous O
Wedding! O

My O
daughter's O
wedding O
reception O
at O
Water's B-TARGET
Edge I-TARGET
received O
the O
highest O
compliments O
from O
our O
guests. O

Everyone O
raved O
about O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
(elegant O
rooms B-TARGET
and O
absolutely O
incomparable O
views B-TARGET
) O
and O
the O
fabulous O
food B-TARGET
! O

Service B-TARGET
was O
wonderful; O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O
and O
helpful. O

Paul B-TARGET
, O
the O
maitre O
d', O
was O
totally O
professional O
and O
always O
on O
top O
of O
things. O

Thank O
you O
everyone O
at O
Water's B-TARGET
Edge I-TARGET
. O

Ruth, O
mother O
of O
the O
Bride O

would O
NOT O
go O
back. O

Service B-TARGET
ok O
but O
unfriendly,filthy O
bathroom B-TARGET
. O

The O
high O
prices O
you're O
going O
to O
pay O
is O
for O
the O
view B-TARGET
not O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
bar B-TARGET
drinks I-TARGET
were O
Eh, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least. O

The O
stuff B-TARGET
tilapia I-TARGET
was O
horrid...tasted O
like O
cardboard. O

We O
thought O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
would O
be O
better, O
Wrong! O

$170 O
down O
the O
toilet... O

oh O
speaking O
of O
bathroom O
, O
the O
mens B-TARGET
bathroom I-TARGET
was O
disgusting. O

The O
floor O
was O
wet, O
the O
trash O
can O
filled O
with O
hand O
towels O
n O
all O
over O
the O
floor, O
no O
soap, O
and O
no O
hand O
towels O
left. O

Go O
to O
son O
cubano O
in O
edgewater O
nj O
instead. O

Good O
Experience O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre-theater O
menu O
(offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$65 O
pp). O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
was O
extensive O
- O
though O
the O
staff B-TARGET
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
"free" O
appetizer B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
olives I-TARGET
was O
disappointing. O

However, O
our O
main B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
was O
wonderful. O

I O
had O
fish B-TARGET
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-TARGET
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations. O

The O
dessert O
(we O
had O
a O
pear B-TARGET
torte I-TARGET
) O
was O
good O
- O
but, O
once O
again, O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions. O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location B-TARGET
. O

All O
in O
all, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-TARGET
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff B-TARGET
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future. O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating B-TARGET
is O
great:it's O
romantic,cozy O
and O
private. O

The O
boths B-TARGET
are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they're O
perfect O
for O
2 O
people. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentive(thanks O
to O
the O
service B-TARGET
button I-TARGET
on O
your O
table) O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
took O
our O
order. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ok O
and O
fair O
nothing O
to O
go O
crazy. O

over. O

Over O
all O
the O
looks B-TARGET
of O
the O
place O
exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals B-TARGET
. O

So O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
not O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

Will O
prob. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once. O

Impressed... O

Subtle O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service B-TARGET
and O
food B-TARGET
I O
enjoy. O

Servers O
are O
all O
different, O
Greg B-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite. O

Sometimes O
tables O
don't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server B-TARGET
who O
has O
personality, O
professionalism, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I've O
been O
that O
a O
runner B-TARGET
remembers O
my O
order... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant. O

Prices O
are O
fair O
across O
the O
board O
for O
both O
food B-TARGET
and O
bev B-TARGET
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses, O
servers B-TARGET
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place. O

BEST O
DINING O
EXPERIENCE O
IN O
THE O
WEST O
VILLAGE! O

Stepping O
into O
Casa B-TARGET
La I-TARGET
Femme I-TARGET
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O
York! O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-TARGET
to O
the O
food B-TARGET
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had! O

The O
have O
a O
great O
cocktail B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Citrus I-TARGET
Vodka I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lime I-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mint I-TARGET
leaves I-TARGET
that O
is O
to O
die O
for! O

Food B-TARGET
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for. O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly B-TARGET
dancing I-TARGET
show I-TARGET
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd. O

I O
never O
write O
on O
these O
sites O
but O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
def O
worth O
commending! O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village! O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food B-TARGET
! O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
looked O
great, O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-TARGET
came, O
it O
was O
average. O

Nevertheless, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate, O
and O
that's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
at O
the O
bottom. O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager B-TARGET
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
(but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for). O

When O
the O
bill O
came, O
nothing O
was O
comped, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine, O
but O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it. O

Yes, O
I O
ate O
the O
food, O
but O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O
maggot O
before O
eating, O
and O
I O
was O
at O
this O
point O
fairly O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
(which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food), O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession. O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
didn't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food B-TARGET
. O

For O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
. O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
isn't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world, O
but O
it's O
pretty O
good, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting. O

Unhygienic O

I O
do O
not O
recommend. O

I O
went O
there O
2times O
. O

I O
got O
hair O
in O
my O
food B-TARGET
2 O
times O
of O
then O
! O

Great O
place B-TARGET
, O
great O
value. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
flavorful, O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit-in. O

Awesome O

Inexpensive, O
unassuming, O
great O
time! O

Sushi B-TARGET
experience O
was O
unbelievable O
with O
my O
fiance. O

Try O
it! O

Very O
pleased O

Good O
creative O
rolls B-TARGET
! O

Yamato B-TARGET
is O
an O
excellent O
place O
to O
go O
if O
youre O
not O
into O
sashimi, O
or O
if O
you O
have O
friends O
who O
doesnt O
like O
sushi O
much. O

They O
have O
great O
rolls B-TARGET
, O
the O
triple B-TARGET
color I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
norwegetan I-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
, O
are O
awesome O
and O
filling. O

One O
special B-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
and O
one O
regular B-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
is O
enough O
to O
fill O
you O
up, O
but O
save O
room O
for O
dessert B-TARGET
! O

They O
have O
a O
delicious O
banana B-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
dessert I-TARGET
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
great O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
tempura I-TARGET
. O

The O
appetizers B-TARGET
are O
also O
delicious! O

Amazing O
food B-TARGET
. O

Mazing O
interior B-TARGET
. O

Great O
food B-TARGET
! O

I've O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern B-TARGET
Japanese I-TARGET
and O
this O
spot O
delivers. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
mirrors I-TARGET
. O

If O
you're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey, O
that's O
a O
good O
thing. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors B-TARGET
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go-to O
for O
modern B-TARGET
Japanese I-TARGET
food I-TARGET
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future. O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre-fix O
was O
$29/per O
person O
including O
sake O
but O
it O
is O
$55 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
sake. O

Indo B-TARGET
Chinese I-TARGET
food I-TARGET
, O
pretty O
good... O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place B-TARGET
but O
very O
good O
Chinese B-TARGET
style I-TARGET
Indian I-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
lollipop I-TARGET
is O
my O
favorite, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
(I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer) O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli B-TARGET
Chicken I-TARGET
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place, O
but O
even O
she O
(being O
Indian) O
feels O
the O
food B-TARGET
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
:) O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food B-TARGET
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant, O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
majorly O
disappointing. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish. O

Rather O
than O
preparing O
vegetarian B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
, O
the O
chef B-TARGET
presented O
me O
with O
a O
plate O
of O
steamed O
vegetables O
(minus O
sauce, O
seasoning, O
or O
any O
form O
or O
aesthetic O
presentation). O

I O
was O
so O
stunned, O
and O
I O
left O
the O
dinner O
hungry O
and O
majorly O
disappointing. O

This O
place B-TARGET
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
return. O

Best O

This O
is O
the O

wonderful O

Brooklyn... O

for O
7 O
years O

that O
way... O

never O

Patsy's B-TARGET
Pizza I-TARGET
= O
true O
love O

Hands O
down O
the O
best O
pizza B-TARGET
on O
the O
planet. O

My O
bf O
and O
I O
go O
to O
the O
walk-up O
counter O
and O
order O
a O
pie. O

In O
about O
12 O
minutes, O
the O
thing O
is O
gone. O

Need O
I O
say O
more? O

great O
hot B-TARGET
dogs I-TARGET
.. O

the O
hot B-TARGET
dogs I-TARGET
were O
juicy O
and O
tender O
inside O
and O
had O
plenty O
of O
crunch O
and O
snap O
on O
the O
outside. O

great O
toppings B-TARGET
definitely O
a O
place B-TARGET
you O
need O
to O
check O
out O
for O
late O
night O
munchies O
or O
a O
mid O
day O
boost! O

great O
taste O

Great, O
original O
taste. O

For O
me O
dishes B-TARGET
a O
little O
oily, O
but O
overall O
dining O
experience O
good. O

Helpful O
service B-TARGET
and O
average O
price O
per O
dish B-TARGET
$10. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
strikes O
you O
is O
the O
decor B-TARGET
?(not O
very O
pleasant). O

great O
food B-TARGET

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian B-TARGET
chinese I-TARGET
food I-TARGET
. O

The O
flavors O
are O
amazing O
and O
the O
value O
is O
phenomenal. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait, O
because O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
tiny. O

Also, O
they O
do O
not O
take O
credit O
card O
so O
come O
with O
cash! O

Even O
though O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
beautiful, O
the O
food B-TARGET
speaks O
for O
itself. O

Best O
Indian B-TARGET
Chinese I-TARGET
in O
the O
city, O
by O
far! O

AMAZING O
MY O
FAVORITE!!! O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
NYC O
for O
bit O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene. O

I O
came O
across O
Village B-TARGET
Underground I-TARGET
by O
accident, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time. O

The O
martinis B-TARGET
are O
amazing O
and O
very O
fairly O
priced. O

THE O
SERVICE B-TARGET
IS O
AMAZING, O
i've O
had O
different O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
they O
were O
all O
nice, O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
in O
NYC. O

The O
DJ B-TARGET
is O
awesome, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
keep O
going O
back. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
don't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles. O

Which O
lets O
face O
it....at O
times O
it's O
a O
good O
thing. O

In O
the O
end O
you O
end O
up O
with O
a O
fair O
tab O
and O
NOTHING O
BUT O
A O
GREAT O
TIME!!! O

Highly O
recommended! O

One O
of O
the O
best, O
if O
not O
THE O
best, O
restaurants O
in O
Park O
Slope O
(and O
NY O
in O
general) O

Everything O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
great. O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
the O
real O
deal. O

Wish O
NY O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places: O
intimate, O
superb O
food B-TARGET
, O
homey, O
top O
notch O
all O
the O
way O
around, O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait. O

There O
is O
"Expensive-but-worth-it" O
and O
there O
is O
"Expensive-and-WTF"? O

This O
is O
a O
twenty-something O
guy O
that O
doesn't O
mind O
laying O
down O
$300 O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal O
for O
2 O
on O
special O
occassions. O

But O
$500 O
for O
a O
dinner B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
two I-TARGET
that O
didn't O
include O
Wine? O

Are O
you O
freaking O
kidding O
me? O

Look, O
the O
appetizers B-TARGET
were O
really O
good. O

The O
entree B-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

Can't O
argue O
about O
that, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over O
priced. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-TARGET
and O
the O
name. O

Yes, O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while. O

$500 O
included: O

Drinks: O
2 O
glasses O
of O
Dom O
Perignon O
at O
$35 O
each. O

Starters: O
Kobe O
Beef O
Sashimi. O

Which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
real O
Kobe O
but O
Wagyu O
beef. O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe. O

A O
beef O
Consomme. O

Entrees: O
Vanison O
steak O
and O
Bison O
Steak. O

Vanison B-TARGET
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing. O

Bison B-TARGET
was O
quite O
excellent O
however. O

Dessert B-TARGET
: O
pure O
disaster. O

Just O
not O
good O
at O
all. O

Some O
Pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it. O

I O
was O
wrong. O

The B-TARGET
Four I-TARGET
Seasons I-TARGET
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants, O
but O
trust O
me, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
"I've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant". O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it. O

All O
in O
all, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great O
(except O
for O
the O
dessserts B-TARGET
). O

The O
environment B-TARGET
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-TARGET
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth O
it. O

Yes, O
it O
is O
good, O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper. O

You O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-TARGET
, O
sadly, O
no. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
just O
ok, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you'd O

$500. O

Terrible O
Waste O
of O
money.. O
scammers O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa B-TARGET
La I-TARGET
Femme I-TARGET
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience! O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way. O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience. O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-TARGET
La I-TARGET
Femme I-TARGET
and O
was O
so O
offended O
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time. O

We O
went O
to O
celebrate O
two O
birthdays O
and O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
special O
and O
different. O

Our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least, O
was O
an O
unpleasant O
and O
costly O
experience! O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience. O

We O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
I O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-TARGET
for O
a O
table. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
beautiful! O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant. O

However, O
our O
$14 O
drinks B-TARGET
were O
were O
horrible! O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed! O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better. O

For O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1/2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink. O

We O
also O
asked O
for O
Hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
Hooka. O

After O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them. O

We O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order. O

My O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$55 O
dinner B-TARGET
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka! O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received! O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empy O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
AND O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food B-TARGET
and O
belly O
dancers! O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-TARGET
was O
inedible! O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money. O

MY O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended... O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly! O

I O
wish O
I O
COULD O
be O
refunded! O

Don't O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4! O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner. O

Five O
of O
us O
walked O
in O
at O
approximately O
6:20 O
on O
a O
Thursday O
evening. O

The O
hostess O
said O
"Wow O
that's O
a O
large O
group, O
unless O
you O
aren't O
together", O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
"no O
we O
are, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please." O

At O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
fairly O
simple O
without O
much O
descriptions. O

There O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-TARGET
that O
evening, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
bottled I-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
either, O
we O
went O
with O
Brahma. O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-TARGET
oysters I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
clams I-TARGET
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
(maybe O
3 O
of O
each). O

The O
lobster B-TARGET
knuckles I-TARGET
(special O
of O
the O
day) O
were O
ok, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
"salt B-TARGET
encrusted I-TARGET
shrimp" I-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
(which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma's O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay. O

She O
replied O
"well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded." O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her, O
so O
we O
did. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes. O

I O
had O
the O
Thai B-TARGET
style I-TARGET
Fried I-TARGET
Sea I-TARGET
Bass I-TARGET
...which O
was O
very O
good. O

Everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy O
with O
their O
food B-TARGET
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
Mahi I-TARGET
Mahi I-TARGET
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
Grapfruit O
Juice! O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
was O
excellent. O

They O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
(my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand). O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side, O
but O
fresh. O

Service B-TARGET
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
"large O
party"! O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here. O

Great O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had. O

Very O
"normal O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
", O
but O
done O
really O
well. O

I O
have O
it O
a O
4 O
instead O
of O
5 O
because O
of O
the O
price O
(just O
chicken B-TARGET
tikka I-TARGET
masala I-TARGET
- O
no O
bread O
of O
rice O
- O
is O
$25), O
which O
I O
would O
expect O
at O
a O
upscale O
Indian O
restaurant O
but O
this O
place B-TARGET
doesn't O
have O
an O
upscale O
feel B-TARGET
. O

Also, O
waiters B-TARGET
try O
to O
push O
more O
food O
on O
you, O
like O
suggest O
things O
as O
if O
they O
are O
complimentary O
when O
they O
actually O
cost O
$. O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
(more O
than O
the O
price). O

But O
if O
you're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place B-TARGET
to O
go O
for O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET

The O

worth O
it. O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed. O

We O
have O
gone O
for O

only O
a O

but O
the O

great O

and O
service B-TARGET

Wretched O
and O
retching O

This O
will O
be O
only O
the O
third O
online O
review O
I O
have O
ever O
made O
about O
a O
restaurant O
in O
my O
life. O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food B-TARGET
an O
service B-TARGET
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else's O
order. O

Fine, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that. O

However, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean B-TARGET
fair I-TARGET
, O
(sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it's O
your O
only O
option), O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-TARGET
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting, O
slimy, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin. O

Not O
one O
to O
jump O
to O
complaints O
(hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O
online O
reviewing), O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
give O
them O
a O
heads O
up O
that O
their O
kitchen O
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O
prep O
stations. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation. O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet. O

My O
girlfriend, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-TARGET
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant. O

Not O
only O
have O
I O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
for O
many O
years, O
I O
am O
now O
in O
culinary O
school, O
I O
am O
a O
huge O
lover O
of O
oysters O
and O
fish, O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
is O
half O
Korean! O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish. O

It O
wasn't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand, O
but O
now O
it's O
simply O
repulsive. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk. O

Gorgeous O
place B-TARGET
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night. O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white B-TARGET
organza I-TARGET
tent I-TARGET
which O
included O
a O
four B-TARGET
course I-TARGET
prix I-TARGET
fix I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing! O

I O
completely O
recommend O
Casa B-TARGET
La I-TARGET
Femme I-TARGET
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress O
your O
date. O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight. O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi-bokum. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart. O

The O
bibimbap B-TARGET
was O
average, O
but O
the O
stone B-TARGET
bowl I-TARGET
wasn't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$2 O
for O
the O
stone B-TARGET
bowl I-TARGET
. O

The O
nakgi-bokum B-TARGET
was O
horrible. O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried B-TARGET
squid I-TARGET
I've O
ever O
tasted. O

The O
sauce B-TARGET
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean. O

The O
side B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
were O
passable, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-TARGET
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
wasn't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited. O

She O
just O
nodded O
and O
walked O
off. O

There O
were O
no O
communications O
issues O
either, O
as O
she O
spoke O
perfect O
English. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-TARGET
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village. O

Authentic O

food O

should O
visit O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

We've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there. O

We've O
tried O
before O
but O
it O
always O
packed O
and O
doesn't O
take O
reservations. O

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait. O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto B-TARGET
which O
was O
amazing. O

It O
doesn't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal. O

The O
farro B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
and O
the O
mashed B-TARGET

were O
also O
extremely O
tasty. O

the O
city O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
we O
always O
go. O

A O
quintessential O
slice B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
NYC I-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
. O

The O
crust B-TARGET
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew, O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-TARGET
is O
great, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components. O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
better, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good. O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
City O

This O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite O
modern B-TARGET
Japanese I-TARGET
brasserie I-TARGET
(that O
don’t O
serve O
sushi), O
and O
in O
my O
opinion, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city! O

Not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden O
spot B-TARGET
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-TARGET
wooden I-TARGET
doors I-TARGET
, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate O
décor B-TARGET
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you’re O
no O
longer O
in O
the O
city. O

If O
you’re O
planning O
to O
come O
here, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you’ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private B-TARGET
booths I-TARGET
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
(choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass B-TARGET
ceilings I-TARGET
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky!). O

It’s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘excuse O
me’ O
before O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE B-TARGET
$29 I-TARGET
fixe I-TARGET
prix I-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake! O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it. O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-TARGET
amuse I-TARGET
bouche I-TARGET
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled B-TARGET
Black I-TARGET
Cod I-TARGET
as O
my O
entree, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled B-TARGET
Salmon I-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
was O
better. O

The O
entrees O
were O
served O
with O
miso O
soup O
and O
rice. O

The O
sake’s B-TARGET
complimented O
the O
courses O
very O
well O
and O
is O
successfully O
easing O
me O
into O
the O
sake O
world. O

For O
desserts, O
we O
tried O
the O
frozen B-TARGET
black I-TARGET
sesame I-TARGET
mousse I-TARGET
(interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary) O
and O
matcha B-TARGET
(powdered I-TARGET
green I-TARGET
tea) I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
blueberry I-TARGET
cheesecake I-TARGET
, O
which O
was O
phenomenal. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
(I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point, O
but O
I O
just O
can’t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie B-TARGET
. O

I O
don’t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once, O
what O
more O
twice, O
but O
I’ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi B-TARGET
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment! O

The O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night. O

We O
were O
10 O
people O
celebrtating O
a O
birthday, O
we O
sat O
in O
the O
tent. O

We O
paid O
a O
fixed O
pricce O
but O
got O
nothing!! O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service B-TARGET
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$500 O
for O
some O
drinks B-TARGET
adn O
their O
pita B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
! O

Stay O
away O

Great O
Shabu B-TARGET
Shabu I-TARGET

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week, O
particularly O
when O
it's O
cold! O

I O
love O
it. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-TARGET
but O
wasn't O
too O
impressed. O

But O
for O
the O
Shabu B-TARGET
Shabu I-TARGET
, O
you O
won't O
find O
much O
better O
in O
NY. O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
(shabu O
Tatsu) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi. O

The O
meat B-TARGET
is O
fresh, O
the O
sauces B-TARGET
are O
great, O
you O
get O
kimchi B-TARGET
and O
a O
salad B-TARGET
free O
with O
your O
meal B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
too. O

Dokebi O
gives O
Williamsburg O
the O
right O
one-two O
punch O
of O
classic O
Korean B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
and O
fusion B-TARGET
twists I-TARGET
like O
pork B-TARGET
belly I-TARGET
tacos I-TARGET
. O

The O
hot B-TARGET
dogs I-TARGET
are O
good, O
yes, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-TARGET
croquette I-TARGET
sandwich I-TARGET
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-TARGET
. O

Restaurant O
with O
a O
view B-TARGET

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here. O

The O
food B-TARGET
tasted O
very O
good. O

The O
family B-TARGET
seafood I-TARGET
entree I-TARGET
was O
very O
good. O

The O
main B-TARGET
entree I-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
good. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
good, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again. O

This O
place B-TARGET
doesn't O
make O
any O
sense O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money. O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor B-TARGET
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored B-TARGET
walls I-TARGET
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional... O

This O
place B-TARGET
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
totally O
weird. O

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-TARGET
tapas I-TARGET
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
doesn't O
work. O

The O
food B-TARGET
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked. O

Go O
to O
japanese O
sushi O
place O
or O
Spanish O
tapas O
place O
- O
this O
creation O
in O
Williamsburg O
is O
a O
misstake. O

Good O
Food B-TARGET

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great O
and O
tasty, O
but O
the O
sitting B-TARGET
space I-TARGET
was O
too O
small, O
I O
don't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner. O

Over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
romantic O
place B-TARGET
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
(if O
possible) O

Loved O
it O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-TARGET
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
great. O

The O
food B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent, O
although O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
the O
margaritas B-TARGET
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about. O

Our O
waitress B-TARGET
wasn't O
mean, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either. O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
earlier O
in O
the O
year, O
though. O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then? O

Regardless, O
we'll O
be O
back O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-TARGET
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

This O
was, O
from O
start O
to O
finish, O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience. O

Lexicographers O
take O
note: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness O
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
Brooklyn. O

The O
servers B-TARGET
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention. O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out; O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in. O

And O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent? O

A O
different O
server B-TARGET
enhanced O
the O
fun, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-TARGET
(which O
was O
delicious). O

Overall O
the O
food B-TARGET
quality O
was O
pretty O
good, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
hasn't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest. O

The O
place O
has O
a O
nice O
fit-out B-TARGET
, O
some O
attractive O
furnishings B-TARGET
and, O
from O
what O
I O
could O
tell, O
a O
reasonable O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
(I O
was O
given O
the O
food O
menu O
when O
I O
asked O
for O
the O
carte O
des O
vins) O

At O
$120 O
for O
two O
people, O
however, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value, O
unless O
you're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive-aggressive O
torture. O

On O
that O
scale, O
it's O
a O
world-beater. O

How O
is O
this O
palce B-TARGET
still O
open? O

I O
honestly O
don't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
are O
avid O
restaurant O
goers, O
and O
we O
are O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
new O
places O
and O
our O
friend O
had O
recommended O
Flatbush O
Farms. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-TARGET
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
appalled. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach B-TARGET
and O
mashed O
potatoes. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$24 O
salmon B-TARGET
, O
and O
I O
have O
never, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy, O
as O
dry, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms. O

At O
this O
point, O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything, O
and O
guess O
what, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away. O

So, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again, O
but O
the O
spinach B-TARGET
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it. O

I O
couldn't O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach. O

I've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs!!!! O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible. O

Guess O
what, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did, O
she O
says, O
"oh O
well, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier" O
No O
apology, O
nothing. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates, O
walked O
away, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it!!!!!!!!!!!! O

No O
desert O
menu, O
no O
apology, O
nothing!!!!!! O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode, O
but O
instead, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager. O

This O
is O
where O
it O
really O
really O
gets O
bad: O
the O
manager B-TARGET
said, O
there O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
we O
can O
do, O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
taste O
that O
she O
didn't O
like O
it, O
and O
I O
cannot O
comp O
it. O

Again, O
no O
apology, O
no O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
get O
you, O
no O
can O
I O
get O
you O
a O
drink O
to O
make O
up O
for O
it, O
nothing!!!! O

We O
refused O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
food O
anymore. O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy, O
the O
drinks B-TARGET
and O
appetizers B-TARGET
, O
and O
walked O
out. O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE. O

THIS O
STAFF B-TARGET
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED. O

I'll O
being O
with O
a O

of O

cool O

, O
good O
pita B-TARGET

and O
grilled B-TARGET

that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty. O

Moving O
on. O

If O
I O
could O
give O
0 O
stars O
I O
would O
do O
so O
for O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

Casa O
La O
Femme O
is O
to O
middle O
eastern O
dining O
what O
Chuckie O
Cheeze O
is O
to O
italian. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews. O

Well...they O
can O
run O
but O
they O
can't O
hide. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
and O
I've O
been O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
restaurants. O

Sometimes O
you O
pay O
a O
lot O
and O
don't O
get O
much O
in O
return O
- O
it's O
manhattan, O
things O
are O
expensive. O

However, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant. O

This O
place B-TARGET
...god O
where O
do O
i O
begin. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene B-TARGET
i'll O
give O
them O
that. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
won't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant B-TARGET
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME!!!! O

How O
this O
place B-TARGET
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter, O
is O
beyond O
me. O

Great O
Hot B-TARGET
Dogs I-TARGET
! O

I've O
made O
the O
trip O
out O
here O
a O
few O
times O
with O
a O
friend O
who O
lives O
nearby O
(I O
live O
on O
UWS). O

Though O
it's O
been O
crowded O
most O
times O
I've O
gone O
here, O
Bark B-TARGET
always O
delivers O
on O
their O
food B-TARGET
. O

The O
hot B-TARGET
dogs I-TARGET
are O
top O
notch, O
and O
they're O
Slamwich B-TARGET
is O
amazing! O

Going O
to O
Bark B-TARGET
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy! O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing--I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
. O

But O
nonetheless--great O
spot B-TARGET
, O
great O
food B-TARGET
. O

Fabulous O
food B-TARGET
- O
if O
the O
front B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
don't O
put O
you O
off O
– O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC. O

It's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions, O
but O
we've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years. O

Each O
time O
we've O
been, O
the O
front B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
(not O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
- O
they're O
fantastic O
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
I O
would O
never O
return. O

As O
BFC B-TARGET
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
house I-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
until O
you O
are O
seated, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later! O

The O
frizzy O
retro O
girl B-TARGET
(with O
winged/ O
Dame O
Edna O
glasses) O
will O
yell O
at O
you O
if O
you O
try O
to O
order O
a O
drink. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
"had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to" O
that O
night O
- O
WTF?? O

I'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff B-TARGET
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely! O

There's O
another O
girl B-TARGET
who O
I O
can't O
describe, O
she O
is O
about O
5'6" O
with O
brown O
hair, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you're O
*really* O
talking O
about. O

I'm O
a O
friendly O
person, O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal. O

Again, O
I'd O
be O
super O
upset O
if O
that O
were O
my O
employee. O

Considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O
least O
$60 O
a O
head, O
I O
expect O
better O
service B-TARGET
. O

So, O
if O
you're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first... O

Maitre-D B-TARGET
-"Eat O
and O
get O
out" O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend. O

The O
food B-TARGET
and O
service B-TARGET
were O
fine, O
however O
the O
maitre-D B-TARGET
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
, O
our O
son's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert. O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel, O
including O
Paris, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman B-TARGET
in O
a O
restaurant. O

His O
response O
was O
smug, O
arrogant, O
and O
condescending, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise: O
you O
can't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre-D B-TARGET
's O
sense O
of O
" O
table O
turnover", O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is, O
or O
else. O

If O
you O
go O
here, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off-night. O

Best O
meal B-TARGET
in O
a O
long O
time! O

Mussles B-TARGET
and O
calamari B-TARGET
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-TARGET
special I-TARGET
which O
was O
perfect. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
which O
was O
very O
good, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish. O

The B-TARGET
Four I-TARGET
Seasons I-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
experience. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-TARGET
is O
even O
better. O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once. O

Highly O
recommend O
it! O

Taking O
Hot B-TARGET
Dogs I-TARGET
to O
the O
next O
level O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint, O
but O
at O
Bark B-TARGET
you O
don't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot B-TARGET
dog I-TARGET
. O

Here O
the O
hot B-TARGET
dog I-TARGET
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available. O

Great O
Atmosphere B-TARGET

Went O
to O
this O
place O
this O
place O
on O
a O
real O
cold O
night O
and O
needed O
a O
quick O
meal. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish B-TARGET
tacos I-TARGET
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok. O

Cool O
atmosphere B-TARGET
, O
the O
fire B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night. O

Poor O
service B-TARGET
and O
management B-TARGET

Don’t O
go O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
! O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa B-TARGET
la I-TARGET
Femme I-TARGET
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour. O

When O
the O
main O
course O
finally O
arrived O
(another O
45mins) O
half O
of O
our O
order O
was O
missing. O

Never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing. O

On O
the O
way O
out, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining O
about O
similar O
issues. O

Can’t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant B-TARGET
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients. O

What O
a O
hassle! O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
not O
outstanding. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
or O
the O
wait B-TARGET
for O
a O
table. O

On O
our O
last O
visit, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table. O

Mistakes O
happen, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine...but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
Al O
Di O
La O
staff B-TARGET
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
don't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops. O

Expensive O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was. O

Wow. O

The O
bread B-TARGET
was O
stale, O
the O
salad B-TARGET
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
well O
cooked, O
didn't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor. O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far. O

So O
rude!!! O

I O
went O
with O
JWILS. O

Her O
review O
is O
above. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience. O

My O
friend O
is O
100% O
right O
in O
the O
experience O
we O
had. O

The O
hostess B-TARGET
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
disappeared. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-TARGET
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
said, O
"can O
I O
help O
you" O
and O
"how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party." O

What? O

The O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were. O

We O
didn't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-TARGET
and O
non-existent O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
. O

bad O
staff B-TARGET

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
good. O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
good. O

But O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
HORRID! O

I O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed O
by O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
and O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand. O

I O
can't O
believe O
that O
it O
was, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food! O

The O
waitress B-TARGET
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
(a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it). O

I O
couldn't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite, O
to O
clear O
the O
table. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
like O
this O
place B-TARGET
more, O
and O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-TARGET
. O
