Very O
nice, O
cozy O
restaurant B-TARGET
with O
modest O
prices O
for O
huge O
portions B-TARGET
of O
delicious O
dishes. B-TARGET

We O
celebrated O
our O
birthday, O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
our O
candlesticks. O

Salads B-TARGET
with O
light O
greens, B-TARGET
meat B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
tender, O
and O
desserts, B-TARGET
in O
particular O
Semifreddo B-TARGET
minal I-TARGET
- O
it O
is O
something O
fantastically O
delicious. O

The B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
are O
polite O
and O
smiling. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
didn't O
like O
a O
bit O
- O
waited O
a O
long O
time O
for O
the O
start O
of O
service B-TARGET
(obviously O
because O
of O
the O
large O
number O
of O
people) O
and O
from O
the O
neighboring O
tables O
no O
one O
killed O
the O
dishes O
when O
the O
people O
left. O

But O
these O
are O
minors. O

The O
overall O
impression O
is O
beautiful. O

Recommend! O

Excellent O
restaurant, B-TARGET
I O
have O
been O
here O
many O
times O
and O
here O
I O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday. O

Both O
I O
and O
all O
the O
guests O
stayed O
very O
satisfied. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
on O
the O
level, O
all O
fresh, O
tasty O
and O
authentic) O

Especially O
want O
to O
note O
alcoholic B-TARGET
beverages I-TARGET
- O
wine B-TARGET
is O
simply O
magnificent, O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
unlike. O

The O
musicians B-TARGET
were O
cheerful O
- O
they O
played O
with O
soul, O
so O
we O
did O
not O
miss O
the O
opportunity O
to O
dance. O

The O
account O
for O
all O
this O
magnificence O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
quite O
small O
- O
especially O
considering O
that O
we O
sat O
for O
6 O
hours O
and O
did O
not O
give O
up O
on O
anything. O

From O
the O
small O
mistakes O
- O
cigars B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
old-fashioned O
- O
too O
dry, O
forgot O
to O
give O
a O
few O
snacks O
"to O
the O
table" O
(instead, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
better O
- O
we O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
eat O
them O
anymore), O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
who O
accepts O
orders O
for O
a O
banquet, O
it O
is O
worth O
to O
be O
a O
little O
welcoming O
and O
more O
interested O
in O
the O
process O
- O
for O
example, O
to O
help O
in O
the O
selection O
of O
dishes, O
something O
to O
advise, O
not O
just O
to O
record O
with O
the O
depressed O
person. O

In O
general O
the O
holiday O
was O
successful, O
everything O
was O
on O
the O
level. O

We O
will O
definitely O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
beautiful! O

For O
me O
it O
is O
simply O
the O
ideal O
interior B-TARGET
of O
a O
small O
restaurant. O

Very O
cozy, O
somehow O
warm O
and O
homely, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
very-very O
beautiful O
and O
with O
taste! O

I O
don't O
want O
to O
leave. O

Prices O
are O
very O
affordable O
for O
the O
restaurant. B-TARGET

Now O
about O
the O
downsides. O

Firstly, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
strange. O

Maybe O
we O
just O
stumbled O
across O
an O
unwelcome O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
his O
appearance O
and O
manner O
of O
speaking O
were O
discouraging. O

In O
addition, O
I O
was O
simply O
disappointed O
that O
the O
officials B-TARGET
either O
do O
not O
speak O
English O
or O
speak O
it, O
but O
carefully O
hide O
it. O

The B-TARGET
officials I-TARGET
for O
some O
reason O
only O
communicated O
with O
me, O
and O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
translate O
this O
to O
a O
foreign O
satellite, O
after O
which O
he O
surprised O
me O
- O
they O
do O
not O
speak O
English? O

I O
find O
this O
unacceptable O
for O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
in O
the O
city O
centre. O

But O
that's O
not O
all O
- O
instead O
of O
one O
soup O
I O
got O
another O
similar O
one O
without O
any O
warning. O

I O
noticed O
this O
not O
immediately O
and O
besides O
I O
had O
absolutely O
no O
desire O
to O
conflict O
that O
evening, O
so O
I O
did O
not O
call O
the O
waiter O
and O
settle. O

About O
the O
kitchen O
I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
brand O
salad B-TARGET
Claret I-TARGET
I O
did O
not O
like O
at O
all, O
there O
are O
no O
claims O
to O
wine B-TARGET
and O
desserts, B-TARGET
I O
did O
not O
take O
meat, B-TARGET
but O
my O
friend O
liked O
it. O

In O
general, O
the O
impression O
of O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
very O
good, O
but O
it O
could O
have O
been O
better O
if O
it O
weren't O
for O
the O
strange O
service. B-TARGET

We O
came O
here O
with O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
eat O
meat, O
drink O
quality O
beer O
and O
watch O
the O
match O
of O
Zenit-Twente. O

Now O
in O
order. O

We're O
going O
to O
have O
a O
happy O
meeting B-TARGET
)) O

It O
was O
good. O

A O
sympathetic O
blonde B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
Elena O
took O
us O
and O
offered O
to O
have O
a O
seat O
for O
the O
only O
free O
table. O

It O
is O
not O
very O
comfortable, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
important. O

Because O
as O
soon O
as O
there O
was O
an O
opportunity O
to O
sit O
comfortably O
- O
we O
immediately O
offered O
to O
eat)) O

She O
gave O
us O
a O
menu O
and O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
think. O

Until O
the O
girl O
came, O
we O
didn't O
think O
so O
much( O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
steak B-TARGET
"Tauer" I-TARGET
first O
of O
all O
to O
the O
chef, O
very O
tasty O
cooked, O
secondly O
to B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
for O
advice. O

Salad B-TARGET
Caesar I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
also O
pleased O
us O
very O
much, O
the O
Greeks B-TARGET
were O
magnificent O
(the O
Greeks B-TARGET
I O
admit O
honestly O
did O
not O
eat O
anywhere). O

The O
beer B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty, O
we O
tried O
different O
ones, O
and O
after O
three O
Velvets O
my O
friend O
was O
given O
another O
branded O
towel.))) O

Pleasant O
little O
things, O
but O
very O
happy. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
calm O
and O
uncompromising. O

Soft O
sofas, B-TARGET
comfortable O
which O
is O
very O
important O
now O
(!) O

They O
are O
well O
combined O
with O
table O
sizes. O

Overall O
rating O
9 O
out O
of O
10. O

Why O
9? O

Because O
of O
problems O
with O
ventilation. B-TARGET

Very O
smoked. O

And O
so O
we O
really O
liked O
it. O

Everyone O
was O
satisfied. O

We'll O
be O
back O
soon.)) O

Your O
prosperity O
and O
success) O

Thanks O
to O
the O
staff) B-TARGET

Yesterday O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
to O
have O
breakfast O
in O
this O
nice O
restaurant. B-TARGET

As O
for O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
here, O
many O
have O
already O
written O
that O
it O
is O
like O
home. O

I O
can't O
disagree O
with O
that. O

I O
rarely O
eat O
oats B-TARGET
cooked O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
I O
do O
at O
home. O

The B-TARGET
portion O
was O
very O
good! O

Also O
ordered O
myself O
for O
a O
trial O
"Napoleon". O

The O
cake B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
the O
portion B-TARGET
large, O
but O
still O
nowhere O
cooked O
as O
my O
grandmother O
cooked..., O
but O
still O
delicious. O

I O
liked O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
but O
did O
not O
delight. O

I O
think O
for O
such O
an O
institution O
very O
even O
nothing, O
more O
and O
do O
not O
need. O

Although O
sofas B-TARGET
could O
be O
made O
even O
more O
cozy, O
more O
"home" O
with O
pillows. O

And O
in O
some O
way O
confused O
the O
glass O
door O
to O
the O
toilet, B-TARGET
given O
that O
there O
is O
a O
table O
in O
front O
of O
it O
and O
visitors O
can O
sit, O
somehow O
uncomfortable. O

I O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
more O
"apartment" O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
more O
"café". O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
calm, O
more O
difficult O
to O
say, O
since O
I O
was O
almost O
alone. O

I O
think O
I O
will O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner. O

Excellent O
location, B-TARGET
very O
tasty O
prepared, O
huge O
portions, B-TARGET
we O
ordered O
one O
hot B-TARGET
on O
the O
four O
(!) O
and O
then O
couldn't O
eat.. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special, O
clean O
and O
quiet, O
music O
in O
the O
neighbouring O
hall, O
but O
we O
especially O
wanted O
without O
music. O

A O
polite O
and O
helpful O
waiter, B-TARGET
alcohol O
can O
be O
brought O
with O
you, O
only O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
something O
more O
of O
alcohol O
from O
them. O

Everything O
was O
very O
nice, O
we'll O
come O
again)) O

The O
establishment B-TARGET
is O
not O
cheap! O

A O
big O
deal O
with O
in O
that O
they O
do O
not O
sell O
alcohol B-TARGET
separately, O
but O
only O
in O
cocktails! B-TARGET

At O
least O
that's O
what O
the O
bartender O
told O
me. O

Wine B-TARGET
only O
in O
small O
individual O
bottles, O
there O
is O
no O
beer B-TARGET
at O
all!!! O

We O
ordered O
a O
few O
salads, O
so O
we O
cooked O
them O
for O
more O
than O
an O
hour!!! O
although O
apart O
from O
us O
there O
was O
only O
one O
company O
in O
the O
bar. O

I O
don't O
understand O
what O
the O
cook O
was O
doing O
in O
the O
kitchen. O

The B-TARGET
bartender I-TARGET
during O
all O
this O
time O
said O
that O
our O
salads O
are O
almost O
ready. O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
pleasant O
interior B-TARGET
more O
here O
for O
some O
reason O
do O
not O
want O
to O
come O
:( O

Great O
place! B-TARGET

This O
rarely O
combines O
a O
cozy O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
a O
good O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
a O
good O
service. B-TARGET

And O
the O
price O
is O
very O
democratic. O

They O
visited O
together O
with O
a O
friend. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
good, O
met O
at O
the O
entrance, O
guided O
all O
the O
way, O
all O
showed, O
patiently O
waited O
until O
we O
finally O
decide O
where O
to O
sit, O
although O
we O
chose O
long) O

Fortunately, O
she O
was O
free O
to O
steal) O

They O
wrapped O
themselves O
in O
pillows, B-TARGET
broke O
down O
in O
a O
coat, O
and O
were O
blessed O
together. O

Food O
was O
brought O
quickly O
enough: O
drinks O
almost O
immediately, O
salad O
minutes O
after O
15, O
hot O
minutes O
after O
10 O
after O
salads. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
- O
Napoleon, B-TARGET
very O
tasty). O

In O
general, O
despite O
the O
previous O
review, O
I O
am O
going O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
there. O

By O
the O
way O
I O
ordered O
Cosmopolitan B-TARGET
- O
normal O
cocktail B-TARGET
and O
alcohol O
there O
is O
enough. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
restaurant O
obliges O
you O
to O
try O
this O
very O
dish, B-TARGET
the O
variety O
of O
variations O
of O
which O
is O
pleasantly O
surprising. O

We O
chose O
Cheburek B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
potatoes, I-TARGET
enriched O
them O
with O
sour B-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
it O
was O
delicious! O

Very O
nutritious O
tender O
dish, B-TARGET
a O
bit O
sharp, O
not O
fat O
at O
all, O
I O
recommend! O

There O
was O
also O
a O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
porridge I-TARGET
which O
I O
would O
have O
rated O
7 O
out O
of O
10, O
to O
my O
taste O
an O
unsuccessful O
combination O
of O
ingredients, O
the O
vegetables O
gave O
an O
excessive O
amount O
of O
juice, O
and O
the O
arrangement B-TARGET
of O
the O
dish O
with O
the O
lost O
egg O
looked O
somehow O
not O
solid. O

The B-TARGET
pork I-TARGET
slice I-TARGET
was O
almost O
delicious O
if O
it O
hadn't O
been O
for O
a O
salad O
piece B-TARGET
(one O
of O
5). O

It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
we O
do O
not O
eat O
rabbit, O
the O
dishes O
from O
this O
meat O
predominate O
in O
the O
menu. O

The O
service B-TARGET
and O
the O
speed B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
delivery I-TARGET
simply O
struck O
us, O
the O
cheburets O
brought O
minutes O
after O
4, O
the O
drinks O
even O
faster, O
the O
snack O
was O
served O
just O
at O
the O
right O
time, O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
had O
to O
wait O
long O
- O
the O
delivery O
(in O
recent O
times O
in O
many O
places O
count O
from O
10 O
minutes O
and O
longer...) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
we O
relaxed O
on O
slippers B-TARGET
opposite O
each O
other, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
private O
gazebo, O
it O
was O
cozy O
and O
we O
were O
not O
disturbed. O

When O
we O
left, O
we O
looked O
at O
all O
the O
rooms, O
we O
liked O
the O
fireplace, B-TARGET
next O
to O
which O
you O
can O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
romantic O
evening. O

The O
bright O
room B-TARGET
is O
also O
good, O
but O
we O
felt O
that O
there O
are O
too O
many O
tables. O

Summary: O
quality, O
cozy O
and O
delicious O
place, B-TARGET
we O
will O
take O
care O
of. O

We O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
Appetite, O
we O
were O
not O
there O
before, O
ordered O
a O
table. O
When O
they O
came, O
we O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed, O
because O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
right O
at O
the O
entrance, O
we O
wanted O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
another, O
but O
we O
were O
kindly O
told O
that O
someone O
else O
should O
sit, O
while O
the O
waiter O
left O
we O
quickly O
sat O
next O
to O
another O
table O
opposite, O
because O
there O
we O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
warmer. O

And O
we O
went O
to O
these O
coldest O
days. O

And O
it O
was O
cold, O
and O
they O
sat O
in O
their O
jackets. O

People O
who O
came, O
sometimes O
did O
not O
follow O
the O
doors, O
came O
to O
ask O
for O
the O
doors O
to O
be O
closed. O

A O
girl B-TARGET
from O
the O
staff O
later O
complained O
to O
us, O
asked O
if O
it O
was O
cold O
to O
us, O
but O
everything O
was O
obvious. O

We O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
especially O
the O
rolls. B-TARGET

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
interesting. O

In O
the O
other O
rooms B-TARGET
more O
cozy. O
so O
in O
the O
cold O
in O
this O
hall B-TARGET
which O
is O
better O
at O
the O
entrance O
do O
not O
order O
a O
table.))) O

They O
visited O
the O
institution O
on O
23 O
February. O

They O
were O
nicely O
met, O
led O
to O
the O
wardrobe O
and O
behind O
the O
table. O

On O
the O
second O
floor O
most O
of O
the O
tables O
were O
occupied O
or O
reserved, O
but O
there O
was O
room O
for O
the O
three O
of O
us. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
conveniently O
made-separate O
grill O
folders, O
Japanese O
menu O
and O
Italian. O

As O
a O
result, O
they O
sat O
with O
them O
like O
monkeys O
in O
a O
shop O
with O
cards))) O

For O
all O
men O
on O
February O
23 O
gift O
- O
a O
rubber O
vodka O
- O
it's O
kind O
of O
unbelievable.... O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
ordered O
dry. O

The O
drinks O
waited O
not O
very O
long-minutes O
10, O
but O
with O
other O
orders O
it O
is O
difficult... O

first O
brought O
salad O
for O
the O
girl, O
and O
we O
sat O
and O
approached. O

Then O
soup O
for O
a O
friend, O
and O
then O
all O
the O
sushis O
(minutes O
after O
30) O
The O
sushis B-TARGET
are O
delicious, O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
- O
quite O
mediocre. O

The O
soup B-TARGET
kim-chi I-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
a O
large O
portion. B-TARGET

Impressions- O
cozy, O
delicious, O
large O
selection O
of O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
any O
taste( O
steaks, O
grilled O
fish, O
risotto, O
sushi, O
pizza, O
pasta, O
ears...) O

I O
apologize O
that O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
each O
dish O
in O
detail, O
because O
the O
impressions O
remained O
common O
and O
we O
did O
not O
order O
anything O
special. O

From O
the O
table O
we O
were O
not O
often O
killed, O
and O
different O
officials, B-TARGET
but O
nonetheless O
all O
were O
kind O
and O
smiling. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
summer O
of O
2010, O
the O
cafe B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
we O
sat O
on O
the O
terrace. O

There O
was O
no O
menu O
on O
the O
table, O
we O
expected O
it O
to O
be O
brought O
to O
us O
now, O
we O
waited O
about O
10 O
minutes! O
but O
there O
was O
no O
one. O
after O
that O
we O
managed O
to O
catch O
another O
boy O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
bring O
it, O
he O
was O
shocked O
that O
we O
didn't O
even O
have O
a O
menu O
until O
now, O
accepted O
the O
order, O
food O
and O
cocktails O
brought O
quickly, O
served O
well O
and O
attentively O
than O
corrected O
the O
initial O
negative O
impression. O

The O
kitchen O
is O
normal O
in O
my O
opinion, O
nothing O
special, O
but O
the O
prices O
are O
clearly O
exaggerated. O

Chocolate B-TARGET
is O
really O
delicious, O
"homemade" O
:) O
for O
desserts B-TARGET
I O
would O
come O
again. O

And O
just O
nice O
to O
sit-communicate. O

What O
I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
point O
out O
- O
regarding O
the O
terrace B-TARGET
- O
tightly. O

It O
is O
not O
very O
pleasant O
to O
sit O
close O
to O
other O
tables O
and O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
men O
who O
sit O
and O
look O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
without O
hesitation, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
specially O
for O
them O
and O
came O
to O
present O
themselves. O

There O
was O
the O
impression O
that O
both O
men O
and O
women O
went O
there O
to O
look O
for O
a O
date O
for O
an O
easy O
time. O

Everything O
else O
is O
very O
cute O
:) O

We O
went O
to O
dinner O
in O
the O
evening. O

We O
were O
offered O
a O
VIP O
cafe O
(see O
photo O
gallery O
of O
the O
restaurant). O

We O
liked O
everything: O
interior, B-TARGET
service. B-TARGET
kitchen. B-TARGET

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
invite O
our O
friends O
to O
celebrate O
their O
birthday O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Administrator B-TARGET
Victoria O
immediately O
made O
a O
menu, O
took O
into O
account O
all O
our O
wishes, O
gave O
advice O
on O
conducting O
the O
banquet. O

The O
meeting O
of O
friends O
(there O
were O
eight O
of O
us) O
was O
great O
- O
everyone O
stayed O
very O
satisfied. O

And O
the O
beautiful O
separate O
room B-TARGET
(see O
photo O
gallery), O
and O
the O
attentive O
but O
hateful O
staff, B-TARGET
and O
the O
original O
kitchen B-TARGET
(we O
took O
8 O
different O
hot B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
and O
everyone O
claimed O
to O
have O
the O
most O
delicious) O
- O
everything O
was O
just O
"super". O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
a O
wonderful O
evening, O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again. O

Our O
wedding O
banquet O
took O
place O
on O
July O
10. O

We O
would O
like O
to O
express O
our O
sincere O
thanks O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
the O
individual O
administrator B-TARGET
Elena O
for O
the O
excellent O
service. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
was O
chosen O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
they O
never O
complained O
about O
their O
choice. O

One O
of O
the O
advantages O
is O
the O
excellent O
location B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
(if O
guests O
come O
from O
other O
cities, O
this O
is O
especially O
important). O

We O
chose O
a O
menu O
for O
1500 O
per O
person, O
ordered O
a O
dish O
from O
the O
chef O
and O
another O
salad, O
but O
even O
without O
our O
additions O
of O
flavoring B-TARGET
would O
be O
enough. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
very O
suitable O
for O
wedding O
events, O
so O
cozy O
and O
solemn! O

We O
had O
32 O
guests, O
all O
had O
very O
good O
impressions. O

Thank O
you! O

Alpha O
and O
Ivan. O

We O
often O
visit O
Tan O
Zhen O
on O
Bolshoy O
Prospekt O
V.O. O

The B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
was O
very O
comfortable O
and O
comfortable. O

On O
weekends O
it O
is O
quite O
difficult O
to O
get O
there, O
so O
it O
is O
better O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

Several O
times O
came O
in O
the O
weekend O
without O
order, O
but O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion O
is O
always O
able O
to O
find O
a O
free O
table))) O

I O
liked O
the O
service: B-TARGET
fast, O
huge O
portions, B-TARGET
helpful O
waiters. B-TARGET

They O
ordered O
a O
banquet O
hall. O

He O
advised O
the O
individual O
approach O
to O
customers. O

Visit O
the O
best O
company: O
on O
Thursdays O
we O
usually O
order O
2 O
salads O
and O
2 O
hot O
ones. O

Favorite O
dishes: O
Troika B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
Calmar B-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
language. B-TARGET

I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
visiting O
this O
establishment O
only O
because O
of O
the O
specialty B-TARGET
dish: I-TARGET
Baklazhanov B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
soy I-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

And O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
is O
very O
delicious: O
fruits B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
hot I-TARGET
caramel!!! I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
mental O
institution... B-TARGET

He O
wanted O
to O
have O
dinner O
with O
the O
girl, O
but O
we O
were O
not O
lucky O
- O
it O
was O
on O
that O
day O
that O
they O
turned O
off O
the O
electricity. O

The O
girl O
who O
served O
us O
said O
that O
the O
kitchen O
could O
not O
offer O
us O
hot O
dishes O
(and O
also O
some O
cold O
ones). O

We O
did O
not O
manage O
to O
order O
anything O
hot, O
I O
will O
not O
judge O
the O
kitchen O
accordingly, O
but O
what O
we O
ordered O
did O
not O
leave O
neither O
positive O
nor O
negative O
impressions. O

We O
ordered O
a O
salad O
shop, O
a O
cheese O
plate, O
the O
girl O
took O
a O
bottle O
of O
Bardo O
wine, O
and O
I O
took O
lemonade O
as O
I O
was O
driving. O

It O
looked O
very O
funny O
as O
the O
waiter O
who O
brought O
the O
order O
poured O
me O
a O
bottle O
of O
lemonade O
into O
the O
wine O
bottle O
:) O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
I O
liked O
it. O

It O
is O
very O
romantic O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
and O
watch O
the O
canal... O

Probably O
because O
the O
channel O
can O
only O
see O
everything, O
but O
as O
already O
written O
before O
me, O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
have O
fun O
with O
the O
contemplation O
of O
students O
of O
the O
evening O
department O
of O
the O
cinema. O

Now O
the O
winter O
and O
on O
the O
veranda B-TARGET
was O
quite O
cold O
so O
that O
the O
girl O
very O
frozen. O

On O
each O
chair O
there O
is O
a O
tribe, O
but O
even O
they O
did O
not O
save. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
our O
order O
was O
not O
big O
it O
was O
given O
long, O
if O
not O
say O
long. O

The O
feeling O
that O
they O
have O
grown O
a O
new O
grape O
in O
the O
meantime O
and O
have O
already O
made O
the O
offered O
wine O
out O
of O
it. O

Another O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
the O
speciality O
of O
the O
menu O
- O
a O
lot O
of O
Persians. O

I O
hope O
to O
look O
here O
again O
when O
the O
street O
will O
be O
warm O
and O
when O
there O
will O
be O
light. O

We O
visited O
this O
cafe O
today. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nothing O
special, O
but O
cozy. O

Plays O
quiet O
quiet O
music. B-TARGET

Good O
service. B-TARGET

I O
ate O
salmon O
salad B-TARGET
(I O
think O
it O
was O
called O
Linda)- O
tasty, O
but O
the O
salmon B-TARGET
was O
salted. O

And O
of O
course, O
after O
reading O
the O
reviews O
about O
Napoleon, O
I O
decided O
to O
try O
it! O

Very O
tasty, O
cream B-TARGET
non-fat, O
gentle. O

And O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
it O
is O
not O
very O
sweet O
as O
it O
happens. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
desserts B-TARGET
on O
the O
menu O
(sweet B-TARGET
lovers O
will O
have O
to O
choose O
from O
them) O
and O
you O
will O
have O
to O
try O
something O
else. O

In O
general, O
it O
is O
a O
good O
place, B-TARGET
and O
if O
you O
consider O
that O
it O
is O
a O
cafe, O
it O
is O
very O
even O
good. O

Yesterday O
we O
went O
to O
Tokyo, O
we O
went O
from O
Mirage, O
we O
first O
went O
to O
Eurasia... O
but O
good O
that O
there O
was O
no O
place! O

A O
reminder O
from O
the O
river O
raft O
that O
is O
further O
to O
Tokyo, O
go O
there! O

I O
liked O
the O
large O
room, B-TARGET
where O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
comfortable O
seats O
on O
sofas, B-TARGET
for O
which O
they O
could O
talk O
excellently, O
without O
noise O
and O
loud O
music. O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
officers B-TARGET
themselves O
are O
still O
puzzling O
on O
the O
establishment, O
5 O
minutes O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
menu. O

That O
was O
enough O
to O
look O
at) O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
good O
enough. O

We O
were O
unexpectedly O
delighted O
with O
the O
action O
2 O
at O
the O
price O
of O
1!!! O

But O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
(compared O
to O
Eurasia O
(beep.hours)) O
there O
everything O
was O
very O
tasty!!! O

Ordered O
a O
spicy O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
big O
portions, B-TARGET
quite O
spicy, O
liked! O

The O
sweets B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
the O
spicy O
sauce, O
very O
good, O
reminded O
the O
sweets O
from O
2 O
sticks. O

Chicken B-TARGET
fillet I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
puree I-TARGET
- O
very O
beautifully O
decorated, O
fillet B-TARGET
gentle O
and O
sufficient O
portions. B-TARGET
(if O
honestly O
surprised, O
thought, O
once O
such O
an O
action O
is O
less O
much) O

I O
will O
not O
describe O
sushis, O
because O
they O
are O
different O
and O
for O
lovers! O

They O
liked O
shrimp, O
Philadelphia O
and B-TARGET
vegetables. I-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
so O
keep!!!! O

There O
is O
a O
great O
desire O
to O
return! O

Discover O
such O
in O
Lakes O
or O
somewhere O
in O
the O
North O
nearby))) O

Horrible O
service!!! B-TARGET

Until O
today O
I O
had O
a O
good O
impression O
of O
this O
bar, O
but O
here O
the O
waiter, O
with O
whom O
we O
tried O
to O
order O
a O
table, O
communicated O
with O
me O
just O
disgustingly. O

When O
asked O
if O
they O
have O
non-smoking O
places, O
he O
bluntly O
stated O
(laughing O
at O
the O
same O
time) O
that O
if O
we O
need O
non-smoking O
places, O
you O
in O
the O
cafe O
next O
to O
us, O
not O
to O
us! O

And O
he O
left, O
although O
we O
haven't O
finished O
communication O
with O
him O
yet!!! O

I O
will O
never O
go O
there O
again! O

Horrible O
establishment!!! B-TARGET

He O
read O
all O
the O
reviews O
below O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
there O
with O
the O
girl. O

As O
it O
is O
believed, O
called, O
ordered O
a O
table. O
asked O
on O
the O
first O
floor O
cozy. O

We O
are O
here. O

For O
us O
reserved O
the O
best O
chair O
in O
my O
opinion. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
classy. O

Villages. O

Sit O
down... O
5 O
more O
minutes... O

There O
is O
not O
even O
a O
menu. O

He O
caught O
an O
officer. O

The O
menu O
was O
brought, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
pearl. B-TARGET

Minutes O
after O
10-15 O
came O
to O
accept O
the O
order O
( O
already O
another O
waiter B-TARGET
). O

Accepted, O
minutes O
after O
15-20 O
brought O
the O
order. O

And... O

Missed... O

In O
the O
management O
there O
was O
no O
anslag, O
but O
here O
is O
the O
feeling O
that O
we O
are O
not O
remembered O
did O
not O
leave. O
Pepper B-TARGET
(which O
I O
still O
had O
to O
ask) O
brought O
us O
for O
the O
whole O
evening!!!!! O

Never O
changed!!!!! O

During O
the O
whole O
evening O
they O
played O
with O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
in O
the O
game O
"Remember O
me O
if O
you O
can". O

However, O
when O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
call O
another O
waiter, B-TARGET
she O
refused O
to O
accept O
the O
order O
because O
we O
are O
not O
her O
table. O
(The O
truth O
called O
our O
waiter O
minutes O
after O
3). O

They O
asked O
for O
an O
account. O
They O
paid. O
And O
the O
debts O
are O
not O
bearing. O

Of O
course O
I O
understand O
that O
tea O
and O
everything O
like O
that, O
but O
their O
size O
I O
want O
to O
determine O
myself O
(the O
donation O
was O
300 O
rubles). O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
gift. O

The O
result. O

Interior B-TARGET
10 O
points. O

Cooking B-TARGET
7 O
points. O

Service B-TARGET
1 O
(or O
zero.) O

Because O
of O
this O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
will O
return O
there O
again. O
our O
account O
for O
two O
amounted O
to O
3700 O
rubles O
- O
an O
alternative O
pen-bar. O

Recommendation: O
Teach O
the O
staff B-TARGET
to O
work O
at O
least O
normally! O

Last O
Sunday O
they O
looked O
at O
Metropol O
to O
quietly O
and O
unobtrusively O
mark O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
wedding. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
a O
surprise. O

Usually O
before O
visiting O
restaurants O
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
try O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O
them O
through O
websites, O
to O
look O
at O
menus, O
so O
to O
understand O
where O
we O
are O
going O
in O
general O
and O
what O
to O
expect, O
both O
from O
the O
kitchen O
and O
from O
the O
price O
policy. O

So O
I O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
first O
impression O
of O
the O
restaurant O
- O
despite O
the O
fairly O
democratic O
prices, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
done O
perfectly, O
the O
impression O
of O
expensiveness, O
maybe O
even O
luxury O
is O
created... O

In O
general, O
I O
did O
not O
expect. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite, O
ranging O
from O
a O
girl B-TARGET
hostel I-TARGET
downstairs O
to O
several O
waiters. B-TARGET

I O
liked O
the O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Formation B-TARGET
interesting, O
competent O
- O
dishes O
to O
eat) O

The O
taste O
is O
not O
lagging O
behind, O
for O
example, O
I O
liked O
the O
deep-fried B-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
gophers, I-TARGET
red I-TARGET
yeast I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
"shants", I-TARGET
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
cancelled O
(I O
don't O
know O
if O
they O
are O
salted O
or O
not), O
the O
combination O
of O
ingredients B-TARGET
is O
excellent. O

Beer B-TARGET
is O
good, O
I O
wouldn’t O
say O
it’s O
the O
best O
in O
town, O
but O
at O
the O
level O
(my O
personal O
subjective O
opinion) O
with O
the O
most O
delicious O
beer O
I’ve O
tried O
in O
Peter’s... O

They O
left O
even O
a O
small O
review O
in O
the O
magic O
book. O

In O
the O
near O
future O
we O
will O
go O
there O
again O
for O
a O
more O
thorough O
acquaintance O
with O
the O
menu) O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
very O
even O
good. O

No O
particular O
paphos. O

Quiet, B-TARGET
less I-TARGET
quiet, I-TARGET
has I-TARGET
a O
place O
for O
rest. O

Just O
like O
on O
the O
roof. O

On O
the O
menu: O
the O
most O
unique O
steak B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
truffle I-TARGET
oil. I-TARGET

Salads B-TARGET
are O
almost O
everything. O

A O
good O
dessert B-TARGET
with O
black. O

They O
were O
at O
the O
opening, O
marked O
this O
place. O

A O
couple O
of O
times O
came O
when O
there O
was O
very O
little O
people. O

In O
such O
a O
situation, O
you O
can O
also O
put O
10. O

And O
when O
they O
came O
in O
the O
evening, O
and O
Ivanushka's O
group O
also O
performed, O
here O
it O
became O
worse. O

The O
hall O
was O
full, O
but O
a O
couple O
of O
tables O
were O
empty, O
while O
the O
officials B-TARGET
could O
not O
handle, O
served O
long. O

With O
cocktails B-TARGET
of O
misery, O
the O
margarine B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
club-like, I-TARGET
not O
club-like O
at O
all, O
but O
from O
syrup. O

For O
some O
reason, O
what O
we O
did O
not O
order O
was O
included O
in O
the O
account. O

But O
in O
principle O
it O
did O
not O
spoil O
our O
mood, O
because O
everyone O
saved O
Ivanushki. O

The O
result: O
we O
liked O
it. O

In O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
itself O
I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back. O

The O

The B-TARGET

Excellent O

My O

Nice O
interior B-TARGET
- O
very O
light O
on O
the O

and O
cozy. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

I'm O
sorry O
there O
is O
no O
ham B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
rabbit I-TARGET
- O
but O
just O
opened, O
I O
think O
the O
menu O
will O
grow! O
and O
from O
pig B-TARGET
I O
tried O
pieces O
from O
my O
husband O
- O
gently, O
sweetly, O
a O
hundred O
years O
I O
did O
not O
eat O
anything O
like O
it O
and O
not O
dried, O
as O
usual)))) O
salad B-TARGET
Caesar I-TARGET
- O
the O
most O
delicious O
option O
for O
my O
whole O
life O
(and O
where O
I O
just O
Caesar O
did O
not O
try!) O
and O
very O
delicious O
pasta.. B-TARGET
all O
that O
we O
ordered O
we O
liked, O
and O
we O
with O
my O
husband O
both O
extremely O
pleasant O
in O
the O
food. O
young O
people. O

It O
is O
to O
be O
wished O
that O
this O
restaurant O
develops O
and O
does O
not O
deteriorate. O

On O
leaving O
we O
received O
a O
card. O

Just O
don't O
pick O
up O
the O
cards O
- O
you'll O
have O
to O
wait O
again O
and O
again! O

The O
wedding O
ceremony O
of O
05.08.2010 O
was O
celebrated O
in O
this O
restaurant. O

Very O
pleasant, O
cozy O
and O
quiet O
environment. B-TARGET

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
truly O
family-friendly. O

Staff B-TARGET
attentive, O
service B-TARGET
super!!! O

Take O
into O
account O
all O
wishes!!! O

They O
are O
wonderfully O
prepared! O

Very O
delicious O
dishes, B-TARGET
all O
of O
the O
quality, O
perfectly O
prepare O
meat!!! B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
a O
wonderful O
impression!!!! O

They O
were O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
April O
26. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
very O
cozy. O

I O
liked O
the O
audience B-TARGET
there. O

And O
foreigners O
and O
students O
sat O
down. O

Different O
people. O
and O
everyone O
was O
provided O
a O
good O
reception. B-TARGET

From O
the O
menu B-TARGET
everything O
is O
delicious O
and O
sounds O
and O
looks. O

When O
they O
tried, O
they O
were O
convinced. O

Yeli O
hachapuri. O
dry O
cheese, O
pork O
and O
seafood O
salad. O

Everything O
is O
delicious. O

More O
liked O
хачапури B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
cheese. I-TARGET

Whether O
it O
was O
because O
she O
was O
hungry O
or O
because O
the O
truth O
was O
delicious..... O

They O
drank O
Georgian O
wine. O

Also O
quite O
good. O

The O
average O
score O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
quite O
good. O
but O
only O
purely O
because O
of O
wine. O

I O
think O
the O
place B-TARGET
is O
worthwhile O
and O
inexpensive. O

Plays O
background O
music. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
polite O
and O
welcoming. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
romantic. O

They O
are O
well O
prepared. O

Consistent O
with O
previous O
reviews: O
the O
tables B-TARGET
are O
too O
close O
to O
each O
other. O

For O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
hotel O
I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
too O
dark O
and O
dark O
from O
inside, O
on O
the O
street O
well, O
wooden B-TARGET
tables I-TARGET
and O
chairs B-TARGET
under I-TARGET
umbrellas, I-TARGET
fresh B-TARGET
air I-TARGET
- O
there O
we O
settled. O

The O
girls O
of O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
clearly O
do O
not O
understand O
their O
purpose, O
neither O
smiles, O
nor O
a O
glance, O
nor O
advice O
on O
the O
choice O
of O
dishes O
I O
did O
not O
see. O

There O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
they O
were O
not O
happy O
at O
all O
that O
we O
came. O

Well, O
I'll O
ask O
about O
the O
chopstick: O
"How O
long O
will O
it O
take?" O
Answers O
"Yes, O
no, O
the O
people O
aren't O
much, O
not O
long" O
I O
order. O

Well O
that O
would O
not O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
carry O
a O
chestnut O
to O
me O
exactly O
an O
hour, O
if O
not O
more. O

From O
friends O
we O
heard O
that O
the O
ham O
there O
is O
delicious. O

I O
really O
didn't O
like O
the O
dry O
meat, B-TARGET
but O
the O
red B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
ham O
is O
delicious. O

The O
cold B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
"Lapin I-TARGET
Kulta" I-TARGET
also O
pleased. O

In O
the O
rest O
I O
did O
not O
like O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood, I-TARGET
some O
"sour", O
something O
in O
it O
is O
not O
enough, O
the O
boat B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
pavilion O
also O
not O
what O
I O
wanted. O

Wine O
is O
asked O
cold, O
they O
say O
yes, O
they O
bring O
almost O
from O
under O
the O
heater. O

Morning B-TARGET
enjoyed O
and O
tea B-TARGET
green I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
lemon.. I-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
very O
non-binding. O

They O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
and O
after O
a O
while O
they O
go O
out O
looking O
if O
anyone O
needs O
anything. O

We O
wanted O
to O
ask O
for O
an O
account O
and O
already O
thought O
that O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
turned O
already O
))) O

But O
in O
general O
we O
sat O
well, O
after O
all O
the O
most O
important O
company!! O

We O
were O
in O
your O
restaurant O
a O
big O
company, O
celebrated O
the O
birthday!!!!! O

I O
really O
liked O
your O
restaurant, B-TARGET
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
nice! O

I O
can O
say O
that O
everything O
was O
on O
the O
level, O
delicious O
dishes!!! B-TARGET

Very O
good O
music, B-TARGET
I O
think O
it O
is O
the O
musical O
option O
that O
suits O
everyone, O
and O
the O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
helps O
to O
stay O
longer, O
especially O
if O
there O
is O
still O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

I O
note O
the O
service B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
level, O
huge O
thanks O
to O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
Vusala!!!! O

The O
next O
birthday O
is O
definitely O
for O
you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
attention! O

In O
the O
first O
I O
write O
a O
review O
about O
the O
restaurant, O
because O
it O
is O
impossible O
not O
to O
write. O

The O
wedding O
was O
held O
on O
17 O
August O
for O
45 O
people. O

We O
and O
our O
guests O
were O
delighted O
with O
everything. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
varied, O
the O
service B-TARGET
at O
the O
highest O
level!! O

By O
the O
way, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
food B-TARGET
that O
was O
left O
with O
us O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
evening. O

But O
even O
more O
we O
liked O
the O
service B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters, O
they O
were O
very O
attentive O
and O
polite! O

Special O
thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
Vladimir, O
for O
his O
patience O
and O
care, O
serving O
our O
elderly O
relatives. O

They O
still O
remember O
you O
with O
good O
words O
)))!!!! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
holiday! O

I O
strongly O
recommend O
to O
all O
my O
acquaintances! O

I O
really O
like O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

As O
many O
years O
ago O
service B-TARGET
at O
a O
high O
level. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
so O
smiling O
and O
attentive, O
they O
will O
always O
clarify O
whether O
you O
liked O
everything, O
whether O
you O
need O
something O
more O
and O
if O
you O
ask O
- O
I O
recommend O
something. O

I O
service O
quickly O
and O
hatefully. O

Interior, B-TARGET
of O
course O
for O
the O
lover, O
for O
my O
taste O
not O
very, O
I O
love O
more O
cozy O
places. O

But O
here O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
really O
good O
and O
for O
such O
a O
wonderful O
service B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
food B-TARGET
I O
am O
ready O
to O
return O
again O
and O
again. O

The O
last O
time O
I O
took O
a O
salad O
with O
mozzarella O
and O
ham. O

Very O
tasty O
salad. B-TARGET

And O
chicken B-TARGET
fillets I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
goat I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
you O
just O
put O
your O
fingers O
on. O

The O
cheese O
is O
roasted O
in O
cucumber, O
and O
the O
tender O
chicken B-TARGET
meat O
perfectly O
complements O
the O
sweet O
orange B-TARGET
sauce. I-TARGET

I O
highly O
recommend O
it. O

A O
friend O
ordered O
a O
calf B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
a O
basket O
and O
also O
remained O
very O
satisfied. O

I O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
Las O
Torres, O
really O
a O
wonderful O
place B-TARGET
where O
you O
can O
have O
a O
very O
tasty O
dinner O
and O
spend O
a O
pleasant O
time. O

The O
only O
place B-TARGET
close O
to O
the O
house, O
which O
works O
until O
6 O
am, O
and O
where O
you O
do O
not O
need O
to O
drive. O

There O
is O
a O
separate O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room. I-TARGET

Very O
many O
tables B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
sofas. I-TARGET

Always O
meet, O
take O
to O
the O
table. O

It O
is O
recommended O
to O
choose O
a O
dish. O

Always O
different O
promotions, O
on O
the O
weekdays O
for O
example O
up O
to O
18 O
hours, O
2 O
meals O
at O
the O
price O
of O
1. O

Now O
there O
is O
also O
Italian O
menu, O
but O
try O
not O
yet O
risked. O

The O
only O
disadvantage- O
can O
bring O
immediately O
both O
soup O
and O
rolls, O
if O
the O
rolls O
are O
hot, O
they O
manage O
to O
dry. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
good O
in O
9 O
out O
of O
10 O
cases. O

The O
delivery B-TARGET
was O
also O
good, O
there O
was O
never O
such O
a O
thing O
that O
something O
was O
not O
reported O
or O
not. O

Always O
arrive O
at O
the O
specified O
time. O

In O
general O
in O
our O
district, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
pleasant O
places. B-TARGET

Very O
nice O
place. B-TARGET

They O
sat O
there O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
took O
the O
pizza O
for O
two. O

I O
don't O
remember O
how O
it O
was O
called, O
but O
I O
remember O
it O
was O
mushroomy. O

Pleasantly O
tasty O
and O
the O
dough, B-TARGET
as O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
correctly O
pointed O
out, O
not O
thin, O
not O
thick, O
but O
at O
once! O
The O
pizza B-TARGET
was O
quite O
tasty, O
very O
well O
felt O
white O
mushrooms, O
but O
seemed O
a O
bit O
fresh, O
so O
9. O

The O
design B-TARGET
is O
very O
well O
maintained, O
a O
rather O
bright O
room O
for O
non-smokers O
and O
a O
dark O
room O
for O
smokers. O

We O
sat O
in O
a O
non-smoking O
window, O
very O
cozy O
and O
bright O
tones B-TARGET
of O
the O
hall O
raise O
the O
mood. O

I O
have O
seen O
bad O
reviews O
about O
the O
staff.... O

In O
turn, O
on O
the O
contrary, O
I O
want O
to O
praise. O

The B-TARGET
manager I-TARGET
was O
a O
very O
nice O
girl, O
a O
friendly O
face, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
walked O
quickly, O
pointed O
to O
the O
menu. O

In O
general O
I O
liked O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
very O
much! O

And O
those O
who O
have O
not O
tried O
the O
wonderful O
Limoncello B-TARGET
drink, O
I O
recommend O
to O
try!! O

I O
was O
delighted, O
the O
truth O
I O
tried O
cream B-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
shell. I-TARGET

In O
the O
restaurant O
it O
costs O
140 O
rubles O
for O
50g, O
which O
is O
quite O
acceptable O
price O
for O
this O
drink! B-TARGET

Thank O
you! O

For O
a O
long O
time O
they O
thought O
where O
to O
go O
to O
mark O
the O
anniversary O
of O
the O
husband's O
parents. O

I O
wanted O
seafood, O
new O
interesting O
interior. O

I O
love O
seafood. O
but O
unfortunately O
we O
don't O
have O
so O
many O
places O
where O
you O
can O
offer O
such O
a O
variety O
of O
Midi. O

And O
most O
of O
all O
they O
were O
already O
out O
along O
and O
forward. O

His O
parents O
were O
very O
fond O
of O
seafood. O

Therefore, O
the O
main O
thing O
for O
us O
was O
that O
they O
stay O
satisfied. O

And O
we O
(and O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
staff) O
succeeded) O

Excellent O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
friendly O
staff B-TARGET
have O
created O
a O
great O
atmosphere B-TARGET
for O
our O
small O
family O
holiday. O

We O
were O
with O
a O
friend O
in O
this O
beautiful O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
June O
10th O
on O
my O

an O
interesting O
combination O
of O

and O
the O
unusual O
underground O
duck O
and O
herder... O

Very O
delicious O
hot B-TARGET
dish I-TARGET
- O
dorado B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
vegetables!!! I-TARGET

I O
advise O
all O

in O
the O
conclusion O
of O
our O
dish O
dessert... O

from O
fresh O
clubhouse!!! O

Thank O

very O
much!!!! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
excellent.. O

we O
met O
a O
girl O
with O
huge O
eyes O
and O
a O
beautiful O
dress.. O

very O
nice O
and O
kindly O
communicated O
with O
us, O
sat O
us O
at O
the O
table O
with O
sofas, O
brought O
water, O
helped O
with O
wine O
selection... O

Everything O
is O
very O
hateful O
and O
professional! O

In O
general O
the O
impressions O
are O
the O
most O
pleasant... O

Everything O
was O
fine!! O

Let's O
go O
back O
to O
this O
amazing O
place B-TARGET
many O
times... O

celebrated O
the O
birthday O
of O
a O
small O
company. O

I O
liked O
everything, O
music B-TARGET
hating, O
the O
girl B-TARGET
in O
white O
who O
served O
us, O
very O
attentive, O
advised O
what O
kind O
of O
sauces, O
offered O
tea, O
warned O
that O
portions B-TARGET
are O
big O
(so O
it O
turned O
out, O
we O
didn't O
even O
eat O
everything O
in O
the O
end). O

I O
saw O
the O
owner O
walking O
around O
the O
restaurant, O
looking, O
apparently, O
whether O
the O
guests O
are O
satisfied. O

There O
were O
several O
other O
companies O
besides O
us. O

The O
rice B-TARGET
was O
well O
made, O
the O
basil B-TARGET
too, O
everything O
was O
finely O
prepared, O
nothing O
more O
sharp O
or O
salted. O

a B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
peel I-TARGET
hot O
as O
from O
a O
furnace! O

None O
of O
us O
stood O
above O
the O
soul, O
so-called, O
and O
the O
cup O
was O
not O
taken O
out O
of O
our O
hands) O

We O
sat O
a O
long O
time, O
and O
no O
one O
hurried O
us O
anywhere. O

I O
wanted O
to O
try O
the O
dessert O
"Indian O
ice-cream" O
but O
it O
didn't O
fit, O
I'll O
leave O
for O
the O
next O
time O
(I O
don't O
doubt O
that O
the O
next O
time O
is O
not O
far O
off). O

very O
pleasant O
impressions! O

Sometime O
I O
went O
to O
work, O
I O
look O
in O
the O
window: O
shops, O
intersections, O
park... O
I O
see O
the O
sign O
"...we O
opened!" O
or O
something O
like O
that. O

I O
looked, O
it O
turned O
out O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Palki" I-TARGET
of O
Japanese O
and O
Italian O
cuisine O
opened, O
well, O
I O
think O
I'll O
go... O
better O
and O
not O
go. O

First O
of O
all, O
no O
one O
met, O
so O
I O
had O
to O
"orient O
myself O
on O
the O
locality". O

The O
restaurant O
was O
empty O
and O
there O
were O
no O
guests. O

I O
chose O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window, O
sat O
down, O
waited O
for O
the O
menu. O

They O
noticed O
me O
quite O
quickly, O
and O
with O
a O
smile O
in O
the O
whole O
mouth... O
no... O
did O
not O
give O
a O
menu, O
but O
asked O
to O
eat, O
because O
this O
table O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
for O
big O
companies O
(this O
is O
at O
some O
time O
of O
the O
day O
in O
the O
morning!), O
well, O
okay. O

Secondly, O
they O
did O
not O
help O
with O
the O
choice, O
ordered O
on O
their O
own. O

And O
I O
ordered O
a O
pasta O
with O
salmon, O
a O
Greek O
salad O
and O
a O
cocktail. O

Thirdly, O
both O
dishes O
were O
served O
simultaneously, O
I O
didn't O
actually O
ask! O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
turned O
out O
not O
tasty O
and O
salted, O
salad B-TARGET
so O
self O
(too O
much O
oil B-TARGET
). O

The B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
is O
incomprehensible O
and O
backwards, O
the O
furniture B-TARGET
is O
not O
comfortable, O
and O
the O
pearls B-TARGET
need O
to O
be O
asked. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
"palkams" O
need O
to O
be O
renamed O
as O
a O
cafe, O
because O
the O
restaurant O
is O
very O
far O
and O
not O
even O
visible. O
or O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
quality B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
service, I-TARGET
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
halls O
and O
of O
course O
the O
quality O
of O
preparation O
and O
delivery O
of O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine. I-TARGET

I O
join O
the O
positive O
reviews. O

This O
is O
certainly O
not O
a O
restaurant O
in O
the O
full O
sense O
of O
the O
word, O
but O
an O
excellent O
cafe B-TARGET
with O
delicious O
cuisine B-TARGET
and O
moderate O
prices. O

The B-TARGET
portions I-TARGET
were I-TARGET
large, O
the O
first O
time O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
take: O
salad, O
the O
first. O
The O
second O
and O
the O
compote O
came O
out O
of O
the O
table. O

Great O
choice O
of O
second B-TARGET
dishes, I-TARGET
delicious O
soups, B-TARGET
baking B-TARGET
also O
liked. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
perfectly O
matches O
the O
status, O
the O
only O
disadvantage O
- O
really, O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
which O
of O
the O
non-smoking B-TARGET
rooms, I-TARGET
whether O
there O
are O
smokers O
everywhere, O
whether O
the O
drawer B-TARGET
does O
not O
work O
well. O

In O
general, O
we O
managed O
to O
go O
there O
to O
eat O
once O
a O
week O
when O
we O
lived O
in O
those O
regions O
for O
work. O

And O
we O
have O
noticed O
that O
we O
are O
already O
waiting O
with O
anticipation O
of O
this O
very O
day! O

The O
restaurant O
is O
not O
big, O
in O
the O
setting O
I O
realized O
that O
there O
are O
regular O
customers O
walking)) O

Chef B-TARGET
made O
wonderful O
desserts B-TARGET
for I-TARGET
Tiramisu I-TARGET

Advice!! O
all O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
served O
on O
large O
and O
heavy O
plates B-TARGET
not O
normal O
shape O
(43) O

This O
restaurant O
was O
the O
first O
of O
the O
dozens O
of O
best O
Japanese, O
but O
the O
sushi O
I O
ate O
and O
tasty. O

They O
are, O
of O
course, O
large O
and O
sweet, O
but O
they O
are O
the O
same O
as O
everything O
else O
and O
everywhere, O
and O
there O
is O
almost O
no O
choice( O

menu O
without O
pictures, O
and O
everyone O
is O
so O
used O
to O
choosing O
dishes O
according O
to O
it))))) O

and O
so O
quiet O
and O
cozy. O

Well, O
this O
place O
is O
more O
a O
thematic O
cafe O
than O
a O
restaurant. O

The O
locker B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
big, O
but O
when O
the O
people O
are O
not O
much O
completely O
normal. O

There O
are O
no O
smoking B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
non-smoking I-TARGET
areas. I-TARGET

In O
general, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
inexpensive O
but O
interesting. O

There O
was O
a O
menu B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
hostel, O
themed B-TARGET
clothes I-TARGET
of O
employees O
/ O
music. B-TARGET

A O
girl O
from O
our O
modest O
company O
received O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine B-TARGET
(very O
nice, O
ordered O
more). O

The O
service B-TARGET
in O
general O
is O
fast O
and O
quality. O

In O
principle O
we O
did O
not O
order O
much, O
but O
from O
what O
was O
ordered O
everything O
was O
delicious, O
fresh, O
quality. O

Plus O
the O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
quite O
understandable O
(I O
would O
say O
a O
little O
home-made, O
without O
any O
pizza O
delicacies). O

The O
price O
in O
this O
establishment O
is O
democratic: O
a O
glass O
of O
soya O
200 O
r., O
a O
glass O
of O
Nemirov-80 O
r./800 O
r., O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
(I O
don't O
remember O
which O
one)-150 O
r., O
cigarettes O
with O
a O
keg O
Kent-100 O
r., O
beer B-TARGET
(some O
kind O
of O
dissolved O
hohllatsky, O
tasty O
however) O
150 O
r.(bottle O
of O
130), O
and O
the O
total O
account O
with O
alcohol O
for O
three O
came O
out O
1470 O
r.+tea. O

Unfortunately O
in O
this O
area O
I O
live O
very O
rarely, O
so O
the O
next O
time O
to O
go O
will O
not O
happen O
soon, O
and O
so O
recurrently O
I O
think O
I O
visited O
this O
place. O

On O
29 O
April, O
the O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
in O
Amulet. O

The O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
very O
satisfying O
for O
us O
and O
our O
guests. O

Everything O
was O
very O
healthy, O
food B-TARGET
delicious, O
the O
menu O
took O
1500 O
per O
person, O
everyone O
was O
enough, O
everything O
left O
us O
packed. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
hot O
snack O
- O
chicken B-TARGET
fillets I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
temp., I-TARGET
from O
the O
hot O
main O
dish O
you O
want O
to O
note O
calves B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mushroom I-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
- O
very O
gentle O
and O
delicious! O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
wonderful, O
the O
young B-TARGET
waitresses I-TARGET
after O
the O
holiday O
helped O
to O
pack O
not O
only O
the O
food O
but O
also O
all O
the O
flowers O
that O
they O
gave O
us! O

The O
new O
hall B-TARGET
is O
very O
beautiful O
- O
bright, O
lots O
of O
space, O
luxurious B-TARGET
suites! O

We O
express O
our O
gratitude O
to O
the O
manager B-TARGET
Liliana O
and O
the O
entire O
restaurant B-TARGET
team. I-TARGET
wonderful O
place! O
next O
time O
we O
know O
where O
to O
go O
and O
which O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
recommend O
to O
friends. O

Sergey O
and O
Vera O
Khmelkova O

She O
had O
dinner O
several O
times O
in O
Amici. O

And O
every O
time O
I O
left O
satisfied!) O

The O
restaurant O
is O
hard O
to O
name, O
but O
also O
the O
category O
of O
cafes, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
the O
establishment O
surpasses O
- O
rather O
- O
cozy, O
small O
corner O
of O
Italian B-TARGET
cuisine!!! I-TARGET

The O
warm O
light O
tones, B-TARGET
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
noble O
old O
chairs B-TARGET
create O
comfort, O
good O
dining, B-TARGET
appliances, B-TARGET
- O
all O
liked. O

Decent O
service. B-TARGET

But O
certainly, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
the O
main O
advantage. O

Several O
times O
I O
was O
at O
a O
business O
lunch,- O
salad, O
soup, O
hot, O
drink, O
and O
there O
are O
several O
options O
for O
each O
position. B-TARGET

Especially O
I O
would O
like O
to O
note O
the O
help O
of O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
in O
choosing O
for O
me O
and O
the O
replacement O
of O
some O
vegetarian O
dishes O
(I O
do O
not O
eat O
meat). O

I O
tried O
the O
pastry, B-TARGET
it O
is O
now O
many O
places O
to O
cook, O
but O
there O
- O
one O
of O
the O
best O
that O
I O
tried! O
sour, O
fragrant, O
delicious O
and O
juicy. O

In O
the O
nearest O
district O
- O
for O
me O
one O
of O
the O
best O
institutions!!! O

27.11 O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
at O
the O
restaurant O
Saltan O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
in O
the O
hall O
where O
the O
aquariums O
and O
live O
music. O

I O
and O
all O
my O
guests, O
and O
there O
were O
11 O
people, O
unanimously O
liked O
the O
establishment. B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
excellent O
service, B-TARGET
the O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
the O
manager B-TARGET
of O
the O
washrooms O
perform O
their O
work O
on O
all O
100. O

Very O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
hearty O
atmosphere, B-TARGET
excellent O
music, B-TARGET
show B-TARGET
program. I-TARGET

The O
belly B-TARGET
dance I-TARGET
in O
a O
very O
good O
performance. O

Our O
company O
remained O
satisfied O
with O
the O
reception B-TARGET
and O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
again O
and O
again O
to O
celebrate O
holidays O
and O
simply O
dine O
in O
this O
restaurant. B-TARGET

We O
will O
recommend O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
to O
acquaintances. O

Sincerely, O
Natalya. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
share O
my O
impressions O
from O
visiting O
this O
recently O
opened O
restaurant O
on O
my O
favorite O
restaurant O
street O
Rubinstein. O

She O
visited O
him O
twice O
a O
day O
for O
a O
business O
lunch. O

So, O
the O
first O
visit O
– O
at O
the O
entrance O
politely O
met, O
planted, O
served O
quickly O
yes O
and O
on O
the O
meal O
there O
were O
only O
two O
questions: O
it O
is O
a O
salad O
soup B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
bread B-TARGET
plate, I-TARGET
and O
also O
salad B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
cabbage I-TARGET
were O
delicious. O

And O
the O
second O
time, O
when O
during O
the O
business O
lunch O
I O
had O
a O
business O
meeting, O
I O
was O
unexpectedly O
disappointed. O

And O
there O
was O
almost O
everything O
not O
as O
expected. O

I O
ordered O
a O
bottle O
of O
white B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
as O
an O
aperitif, O
got O
it O
warm O
and O
uncooked O
and O
my O
bottle O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
refrigerator...someone O
drank, O
and O
I O
waited O
for O
my O
bottle, O
asked O
for O
a O
bread O
plate O
for O
a O
business O
lunch, O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
said O
that O
we O
as O
a O
bonus O
when O
ordering O
the O
wine O
will O
give O
broccoli O
and O
we O
began O
to O
wait...but O
by O
that O
time O
the O
ordered O
whiskey B-TARGET
was O
finished, O
which O
by O
the O
way O
was O
delicious. O

but O
here O
the O
hot B-TARGET
and O
dessert B-TARGET
/we O
ordered O
the O
pancake B-TARGET
/ O
were O
delicious, O
and O
the O
biscuits B-TARGET
were O
also O
delicious. O

And O
everything O
was O
polite O
and O
attentive. O

So O
not O
all O
definitely O
bad, O
but O
also O
not O
good O
enough O
for O
such O
a O
restaurant. B-TARGET

But O
the O
god O
of O
the O
tribe O
loves O
the O
зайду O
still, O
maybe O
there O
is O
something O
to O
praise O
for. O

Peter's O
birthday O
was O
celebrated O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
April O
5. O

From O
the O
first O
minute O
we O
were O
delighted O
by O
the O
staff! B-TARGET
very O
friendly O
waiters, B-TARGET
bartenders B-TARGET
and O
especially O
I O
would O
like O
to O
congratulate O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
Elena! O

We O
were O
immediately O
offered O
to O
drink O
tea O
or O
coffee O
(at O
the O
expense O
of O
the O
establishment) B-TARGET
which O
is O
not O
offered O
in O
all O
restaurants B-TARGET
of O
the O
city! O

The O
event O
was O
attended O
by O
about O
30 O
people, O
Elena O
explained O
to O
us O
very O
easily O
what O
is O
included O
in O
the O
banquet O
menu, O
what O
should O
be O
put O
on O
the O
table, O
and O
what O
can O
be O
refused. O

It O
also O
helped O
to O
calculate O
how O
much O
and O
what O
alcohol O
we O
need O
to O
buy O
for O
our O
event! O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
banquet O
from O
the O
first O
second O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
felt O
the O
mood O
of O
the O
holiday O
all O
the O
staff B-TARGET
smiled O
and O
congratulated! O
was O
very O
pleasant!=) O
kitchen B-TARGET
uncomfortable, O
all O
the O
guests O
ate O
"to O
the O
bottom" O
everything O
was O
very O
delicious! O
excellent O
sage B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
grill I-TARGET
and O
hachapuri! B-TARGET

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
the O
holiday O
of O
soul O
and O
stomach!!!=) O

I O
advise O
ALL O
who O
have O
not O
been O
there, O
definitely O
come, O
and O
who O
has O
been, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
repeating!=) O

As O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
to O
the O
center, O
I O
always O
go, O
even O
for O
a O
cup O
of O
coffee... O

In O
general, O
I O
advise O
everyone!! O

She O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
with O
friends. O

We O
were O
here O
in O
the O
first O
place. O

The O
feelings O
of O
the O
evening O
were O
just O
wonderful! O

Durable O
in O
style O
interior, B-TARGET
polite O
fast O
waiters B-TARGET
and O
stunning O
kitchen. B-TARGET

The O
deeds B-TARGET
are O
really O
above O
all O
praise! O

All O
delicious, O
perfectly O
cooked, O
well O
silvered. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
comfortable. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
thank O
you O
and O
recommend O
to O
everyone! O

Thank O
you O
very O
much, O
girls. O

They O
visited O
with O
friends O
in O
Malevich. O

There O
were O
many O
good O
and O
bad O
listeners, O
and O
they O
decided O
to O
check O
everything O
themselves. O

Immediately O
thrown O
into O
a O
mess, O
the O
entrance, B-TARGET
everything O
beautiful, O
it O
already O
rejoices. O

Inside, O
the O
design, B-TARGET
"hot O
to O
the O
holes", O
there O
were O
no O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
the O
hall O
at O
all, O
the O
bartender O
sat O
behind O
the O
desk O
and O
read O
the O
book, O
apparently O
the O
customers O
here O
come O
only O
on O
weekends. O

We O
sat O
at O
the O
table, O
the O
pearl B-TARGET
was O
almost O
full O
for O
some O
reason. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
understandably, O
could O
not O
explain O
what O
is O
what O
in O
the O
menu, O
so O
ordered O
all O
the O
usual O
that O
already O
and O
so O
know. O

The O
minute O
25 O
were O
prepared, O
for O
an O
empty O
establishment, O
it's O
a O
long O
time. O

The O
general O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
wish O
for O
the O
best. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
but O
judging O
by O
the O
prices O
should O
be O
better. O

Cocktails O
are O
many, O
but O
expensive O
enough O
for O
a O
new O
place, O
"Daikiri O
290r", O
usually O
new O
establishments O
usually O
hold O
not O
high O
prices O
for O
some O
time, O
and O
here O
immediately O
and O
expensive. O

Generally O
to O
sum O
up, O
the O
service B-TARGET
on O
3-, O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
on O
4, O
even O
rather O
4-, O
the O
design B-TARGET
on O
4, O
all O
beautiful, O
but O
trivial, O
there O
is O
not O
enough O
some O
rubber. O

The O
place B-TARGET
is O
medium, O
may O
be O
better, O
may O
be O
worse, O
until O
it O
is O
clear. O

I O
happened O
to O
see O
this O
restaurant O
in O
Restocklab, O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
dinner O
with O
a O
friend, O
decided O
to O
try O
a O
local O
business O
lunch. O

The O
choice O
is O
very O
even O
good, O
at O
a O
sufficiently O
low O
price O
(about O
330 O
rubles O
taking O
into O
account O
drinks). O

So, O
my O
choice O
fell O
on O
a O
salad O
with O
red O
fish O
and O
vegetables, O
seasoned O
with O
mayonnaise O
(the O
fish B-TARGET
in O
the O
salad O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
very O
tasty, O
a O
small O
portion), B-TARGET
cream O
soup O
of O
champagnes O
with O
shrimp O
(the O
soup B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
the O
only O
disadvantage O
- O
I O
would O
give O
shrimp B-TARGET
separately, O
I O
don't O
like O
when O
they O
become O
soft O
and O
salt B-TARGET
would O
eat O
less), O
baked O
pork O
with O
mushrooms O
and O
potatoes O
(pork B-TARGET
is O
sour, O
potatoes B-TARGET
are O
dry, O
to O
this O
dish O
I O
would O
add O
some O
sauce, O
I O
liked O
the O
dish O
- O
on O
the O
stove B-TARGET
). O

My O
friend O
was O
solid O
with O
me O
in O
everything O
except O
the O
hot O
dish. O

Her O
choice O
was O
chicken O
grilled O
breasts O
+ O
spinach O
in O
tomato O
sauce O
(the O
breasts B-TARGET
turned O
out O
to O
be O
dry, O
and O
the O
griller B-TARGET
more O
than O
liked). O

Service B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
hateful. O

At O
the O
entrance O
there O
is O
a O
pleasant O
man: B-TARGET
polite, O
walkable. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
more O
than O
ordinary, O
in O
principle, O
a O
good O
place B-TARGET
for O
lunches, O
but O
not O
more. O

I O
can O
write O
about O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
endlessly, O
I O
want O
to O
come O
to O
it O
again O
and O
again, O
regardless O
of O
who, O
when O
and O
for O
what O
reason. O

Winter, O
for O
me O
as O
a O
magnet. O

During O
the O
day O
it O
is O
pleasant O
lunches, O
in O
the O
evening O
- O
delicious O
dinners, B-TARGET
flowing O
smoothly O
into O
night O
sittings, O
karaoke O
and O
dances. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
nice, O
only O
long O
time O
it O
would O
be O
time O
to O
repair, O
I O
think O
most O
visitors O
would O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
this O
idea, O
although O
the O
old O
interior, B-TARGET
a O
bit O
ruined O
furniture B-TARGET
does O
not O
prevent O
visitors O
to O
come O
here O
again O
and O
again, O
after O
all O
the O
main O
atmosphere!! B-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
winter O
is O
very O
nice: O
good O
and O
delicious O
grill B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
(especially O
fish B-TARGET
), O
standard O
selection O
of O
salads, B-TARGET
a O
large O
selection O
of O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
rolls B-TARGET
(the O
most O
delicious O
Geisha B-TARGET
and O
baked O
Kyoto B-TARGET
), O
a O
decent O
cocktail B-TARGET
card, I-TARGET
only O
here O
Long, B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
desire O
the O
best, O
and O
club B-TARGET
brandy I-TARGET
do O
not O
advise O
anyone, O
disgusting! O

But O
it O
doesn't O
have O
to O
be O
perfect!!! O

Kuryu O
калyan B-TARGET
only O
here, O
I O
believe O
that O
here O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city. O

The O
only O
disadvantage O
of O
this O
establishment O
is O
the O
service: B-TARGET
the O
girls B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
hostel O
with O
the O
absence O
of O
sight, O
imagine O
themselves O
as O
hosts O
of O
the O
establishment, O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
many, O
and O
so O
little. O

On O
weekends, O
especially O
closer O
to O
the O
night O
orders O
have O
to O
wait O
a O
long O
time, O
accounts O
do O
not O
wait, O
and O
if O
you O
still O
want O
to O
take O
part O
of O
the O
surrender, O
you O
can O
even O
sit O
until O
morning. O

I O
still O
thank O
my O
friend O
for O
opening O
this O
place B-TARGET
for O
me O
a O
year O
ago. O

Since O
then, O
every O
trip O
to O
the O
Volcano B-TARGET
provides O
me O
with O
an O
excellent O
mood. O

Before O
going O
to O
the O
main O
one, O
to O
the O
kitchen, O
I O
will O
say O
a O
few O
words O
about O
the O
interior, O
service O
and O
the O
restaurant O
in O
general. O

There O
is O
always O
a O
pleasant O
and O
welcoming O
atmosphere: B-TARGET
welcoming O
girls B-TARGET
at I-TARGET
the O
hostel, O
helpful O
waiters B-TARGET
(but O
sometimes O
not O
very), O
soft O
leather O
sofas, B-TARGET
paintings O
of O
contemporary O
artists O
on O
sale. O

Wave B-TARGET
is O
a O
place O
where O
on O
a O
regular O
day, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
hide O
from O
the O
city O
noise O
and O
crowds. O

But O
all O
this O
would O
not O
matter O
if O
it O
weren’t O
for O
the O
amazing O
kitchen. B-TARGET

Caesar B-TARGET
is I-TARGET
one O
of O
the O
best O
ones O
I O
had O
to O
try, O
the O
Greek B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
surprised O
me O
very O
much, O
I O
didn't O
think O
that O
such O
a O
"received" O
me O
dish O
can O
be O
prepared O
so O
tasty. O

Fetucini B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
white I-TARGET
mushrooms I-TARGET
just O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth, O
pasta B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
crabs I-TARGET
is O
good, O
but O
the O
sauce O
I O
would O
add O
a O
little O
more O
to O
make O
the O
taste O
softer. O

Sushi B-TARGET
and O
roles...it's B-TARGET
a O
separate O
topic, O
in O
my O
opinion, O
so O
best O
in O
the O
city, O
no O
Ginza O
will O
compare. O

And O
delicious O
absolutely O
all, O
the O
most O
favorite: O
Kyoto B-TARGET
roll, I-TARGET
roll B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
sharp O
salmon. O

As O
for O
desserts, O
I O
treat O
them O
more O
than O
calmly, O
but O
Napoleon B-TARGET
cake O
and O
chips B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
Philadelphia, I-TARGET
fruit B-TARGET
tar-tar I-TARGET
to O
the O
positive O
side O
changed O
my O
attitude O
to O
desserts. O

We O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
with O
our O
wife O
the O
anniversary O
of O
our O
wedding O
in O
Shabu-Shabu. O

When O
we O
arrived, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
visitors, O
and O
we O
sat O
in O
a O
small O
hall. O

It O
was O
quiet O
and O
quiet O
until O
the O
company O
of O
4 O
people O
came. O

It O
seemed O
that O
they O
were O
sitting O
behind O
our O
table, O
so O
little O
space O
there. O

In O
this O
room O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
put O
not O
four O
tables, O
but O
two. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
this O
establishment O
we O
very O
much O
liked. O

All O
dishes B-TARGET
are O
made O
from O
freshest O
products. B-TARGET

The O
roles B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
anger I-TARGET
were O
the O
most O
impressive, O
next O
time O
we O
will O
try O
others. O

And O
we O
also O
ordered O
a O
specialty O
Shabu-Shabu O
(Fundyu O
in O
Japanese) O

The O
most O
delicious O
ingredient B-TARGET
is O
marble B-TARGET
meat, I-TARGET
just O
put O
your O
fingers O
on O
it. O

The O
bullion B-TARGET
was O
only O
slightly O
overloaded. O

The O
impressions O
remained O
the O
most O
pleasant, O
we O
will O
go O
again. O

After O
visiting O
the O
movie O
theater, O
they O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
dinner O
with O
their O
husband O
and O
friends O
at O
the O
restaurant O
"Gostina". O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
ordered O
Gaspaccio O
and O
Soljana, O
hot O
dishes O
- O
Tobacco O
Chiplet O
with O
grilled O
vegetables O
and O
Soudaka, O
baked O
with O
sauce O
under O
the O
cheese. O

Gaspucci B-TARGET
was O
too O
sharp, O
although O
I O
asked O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
to O
make O
this O
dish O
not O
sharp. O

The O
tobacco O
chip B-TARGET
was O
delicious, O
but O
as O
far O
as O
grill B-TARGET
vegetables I-TARGET
are O
concerned, O
it O
was O
no O
grill, O
but O
baked O
in O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
butter, O
basil, B-TARGET
cinnamon I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Bulgarian I-TARGET
pepper, I-TARGET
terribly O
unpleasant. O

The O
judge B-TARGET
also O
did O
not O
like O
the O
husband, O
the O
dish B-TARGET
seemed O
fat O
enough. O

Friends O
ordered O
a O
barley B-TARGET
ham, I-TARGET
but O
the O
ham O
(bread O
cooked O
on O
grill) O
it O
was O
not O
at O
all O
similar. O

They O
also O
ordered O
a O
white B-TARGET
distilled I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
and O
complained, O
after O
which O
the O
head O
was O
still O
sick O
(aside O
from O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
in O
the O
restaurant O
alcohol O
was O
not O
used O
that O
day). O

They O
ordered O
a O
basket O
of O
bread O
for O
four O
with O
different O
kinds O
of O
bread, O
almost O
all O
the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
warm, O
soft O
and O
tasty, O
but O
here O
the O
pieces O
of O
white B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
were O
strongly O
delicious O
with O
the O
flavour B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
grass I-TARGET
(( O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
nice, O
quite O
cosy, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
medium. O

We O
will O
not O
go O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
anymore, O
because O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
general O
we O
did O
not O
like. O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
write O
is O
that O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
just O
disgusting! O

I O
went O
to O
you O
three O
times O
(all O
three O
at O
Pioneerskaya), O
all O
three O
times O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
for O
ten O
minutes, O
waiting O
for O
me O
to O
be O
noticed, O
another O
ten, O
until O
they O
brought O
the O
menu... O

Well, O
about O
how O
long O
I O
waited O
for O
my O
order O
to O
be O
accepted... O
I O
am O
silent O
at O
all!!! O

If O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
people, O
I O
would O
understand O
it O
perfectly, O
but O
apart O
from O
me, O
there O
were O
only O
three O
tables... O

All O
the O
officials B-TARGET
with O
faces O
as O
if O
they O
just O
want O
to O
destroy O
me... O

At O
this O
horror O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
interior B-TARGET
very O
even O
not O
bad, O
very O
comfortable O
and O
cozy O
sofas, B-TARGET
and O
of O
course O
your O
wonderful O
promotion O
which O
to O
my O
pleasant O
surprise O
works O
on O
all O
menus, O
not O
only O
on O
dry/rolls!!! O

If O
you O
work O
with O
the O
staff, O
you O
will O
have O
a O
wonderful O
place!!! O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
changes O
to O
come O
to O
you O
again! O

Our O
family O
very O
much O
like O
to O
stay O
in O
this O
cafe. B-TARGET

Enjoy O
the O
kitchen, B-TARGET
availability O
of O
children's B-TARGET
menu, I-TARGET
children's B-TARGET
chairs. I-TARGET

Everything O
is O
very O
tasty O
and O
interesting. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
cosy O
and O
relaxing. O

I O
liked O
the O
service. B-TARGET

We O
always O
reserve O
a O
table O
in O
advance. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
professional, O
but O
without O
unnecessary O
rigidity. O

You O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
you O
are O
not O
being O
served, O
but O
cared O
for. O

Everybody O
will O
tell O
you O
about O
any O
dish O
with O
great O
pleasure O
and O
advise O
the O
best. O

Cleaning O
from O
the O
table O
is O
done O
not O
only O
by O
your O
specific O
waiter, B-TARGET
but O
also O
by O
any O
other O
person. O

And O
if O
you O
drink O
tea O
with O
cake O
by O
the O
company, O
you O
will O
try O
to O
bring O
all O
at O
the O
same O
time O
several O
waiters. B-TARGET

It O
is O
very O
convenient O
and O
pleasant O
to O
drink O
tea O
all O
together, O
rather O
than O
waiting O
for O
others O
to O
bring O
the O
dessert. O

And O
no O
one O
will O
look O
at O
you, O
waiting O
for O
your O
departure, O
after O
you O
have O
eaten O
all. O

All O
for O
complete O
pleasure O
and O
enjoyment. O

Visit O
the O
cafe O
once O
a O
week O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
exclusively O
for O
enjoying O
delicious O
and O
varied O
food B-TARGET
and O
atmosphere! B-TARGET

I O
will O
not O
recommend O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
to O
anyone, O
because O
it O
is O
close O
to O
me! O

On O
Saturday O
evenings O
there O
are O
practically O
no O
places O
in O
the O
non-smoking O
area. O

In O
September, O
the O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
in O
Dubrovnik... O

Every O
time O
we O
met O
the O
owner, O
he O
was O
very O
kind, O
happy O
and O
assured O
us O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
wonderful! O

Everything O
was O
discussed O
in O
advance, O
but O
we O
decided O
to O
send O
two O
guests O
to O
the O
café O
an O
hour O
before O
the O
start O
of O
the O
banquet O
to O
check O
the O
preparations, O
which O
was O
warned O
by O
the O
host! O

When O
our O
friends O
arrived, O
the B-TARGET
host I-TARGET
expressed O
surprise..... O

The O
cafe O
was O
not O
closed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
preparation, O
the O
last O
visitor O
left O
5 O
minutes O
before O
our O
arrival.... O

The O
staff, B-TARGET
to O
put O
it O
mildly, O
was O
not O
enough O
and O
the O
owner O
offered O
our O
friends O
to O
wash O
the O
fruits O
themselves, O
cover O
the O
tables, O
etc. O

Approximately O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
banquet, O
the O
host O
reported O
that O
he O
is O
feeling O
bad O
and O
will O
go O
home O
(must O
be O
added O
that O
he O
is O
actively O
involved O
in O
the O
service)... O

One O
(!) O
waiter B-TARGET
stayed O
with O
us, O
who, O
despite O
a O
small O
number O
of O
guests, O
did O
not O
cope O
at O
all... O

We B-TARGET
literally I-TARGET
cleaned I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
ourselves. O

Tort O
waited O
perhaps O
half O
an O
hour... O

several O
times O
asked O
him O
to O
bring, O
then O
waited O
very O
long O
for O
tea, O
tea, O
etc. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
looked O
like O
a O
boy O
from O
the O
street O
who O
doesn't O
understand O
at O
all O
what O
we O
want O
from O
him... O

In O
general, O
everything O
cooked O
was O
delicious, O
silvered O
well O
too, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
and O
attitude O
shocked O
and O
somewhat O
spoiled O
the O
overall O
impression O
of O
the O
holiday... O

They O
visited O
the O
establishment O
during O
the O
daytime. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
neither O
lunch O
nor O
dinner, O
but O
the O
people O
were O
many. O

The O
interior, B-TARGET
let's O
say O
directly O
any O
one, O
but O
the O
view B-TARGET
all O
forgives, O
even O
if O
it O
is O
the O
Vyborg O
side O
of O
the O
hometown. O

Service B-TARGET
at O
a O
good O
level. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O
The O
room O
was O
clean O
and O
comfortable. O

Satellites O
liked O
everything O
they O
ordered O
and O
salad O
with B-TARGET
crabs I-TARGET
and O
pasta B-TARGET
(fatty) I-TARGET
and O
risotto, B-TARGET
fish B-TARGET
sausage. I-TARGET

The O
desserts O
have O
chosen O
everything O
from O
the O
menu, O
except O
the O
day O
cake. O

They O
were O
fighting O
each O
other. O

I O
really O
liked O
it. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
"Povari" I-TARGET
slowly O
but O
surely O
begins O
to O
turn O
from O
a O
good O
place O
into O
a O
normal O
runway. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
came O
to O
Povari O
several O
times O
a O
week O
to O
eat O
and O
were O
their O
regular O
customers. O

Unfortunately, O
the O
last O
1.5 O
- O
2 O
months O
after O
visiting O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
only O
unpleasant O
impressions O
remain: O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
- O
quite O
"not O
at O
the O
level", O
the O
administrators B-TARGET
- O
they O
are O
under O
to O
become... O

Today, O
after O
a O
few O
"shocks" O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
politely O
asked O
to O
invite O
the O
administrator. O

After O
20 O
minutes O
a O
waiter B-TARGET
came O
and O
said, O
"Excuse O
me, O
but O
the O
administrator B-TARGET
is O
so O
busy O
that O
he O
can't O
come O
to O
you. O

You O
can O
come O
after O
16-00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" O
How O
are O
you O
doing???????? O

There O
are O
simply O
no O
words! O

In O
general, O
no O
one O
who O
knows O
the O
crowd O
in O
the O
nice O
restaurants, O
to O
go O
to O
" O
Repari B-TARGET
" O
I O
do O
not O
recommend! O

It O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago. O

The O
location B-TARGET
is O
normal, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
was O
nice. O

The O
menu O
is O
Italian, O
the O
music O
is O
French... O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
like O
nothing. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
apparently O
not O
the O
first O
freshness, O
which O
is O
why O
they O
burn O
it O
to O
the O
edge. O

Some O
kinds B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
from O
the O
menu O
are O
not, O
explaining O
that O
it O
was O
Friday, O
all O
eaten.... O

Although O
we O
were O
on O
Saturday O
night O
and O
were O
the O
only O
customers. O

And B-TARGET
the I-TARGET
rest I-TARGET
of O
the O
chosen O
was O
normal. O

I O
really O
liked O
the O
desserts. B-TARGET

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
quite O
good. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

I O
would O
have O
left O
again... O

Only O
people O
would O
be O
bigger... O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places!! B-TARGET

We O
spent O
almost O
all O
summer O
there!! O

If O
you O
want O
to O
boil O
and O
drink O
delicious O
beer B-TARGET
with O
shrimp O
shells O
or O
rings, O
you O
are O
here! O

The O
interior O
is O
very O
cozy, O
we O
sat O
wherever O
possible, O
in O
summer O
on O
the O
street O
there O
is O
one O
disadvantage O
that O
they O
sometimes O
stumble O
and O
forget O
about O
people O
"upstairs". O

And O
inside O
I O
like O
to O
sit O
both O
at O
the O
table O
and O
behind O
the O
desk. O

The O
bartenders O
and O
waiters B-TARGET
work O
every O
minute, O
after O
ordering O
the O
maximum O
takes O
a O
minute O
and O
the O
beer O
in O
front O
of O
you O
with O
snacks O
of O
different O
kinds, O
well O
that's O
what O
I O
can O
note, O
that O
was O
always O
tasty. O

I O
advise O
to O
take O
snacks B-TARGET
(including O
cheese O
sticks O
and O
rings O
of O
shrimp, O
potatoes O
and O
cabbage) O
in O
sufficient O
quantity O
to O
drink. O

From O
beer O
personally O
I O
like O
there O
wine B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
mint, I-TARGET
well O
and O
in O
principle O
I O
tried O
all O
kinds O
of O
sweet B-TARGET
beer I-TARGET
there, O
because O
I O
love O
it, O
in O
summer O
there O
were O
about O
5-6 O
varieties. O

On O
these O
weekends O
they O
said O
that O
there O
is O
only O
wine. O

The O
guys O
there O
are O
also O
ripped O
off, O
saying O
that O
the O
beer B-TARGET
is O
super O
especially O
Guinness. B-TARGET

In O
general O
we O
like O
it O
there O
and O
we O
encourage O
friends O
there. O

Sometimes O
you O
can O
also O
ask O
to O
make O
the O
music O
more O
warmer O
if O
you O
play O
some O
famous O
hit. O
:) O

In O
general O
we O
feel O
at O
home O
there! O

Good O
day! O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
we O
celebrated O
September O
09th, O
2010 O
the O
birth O
of O
my O
husband. O

Until O
this O
day O
pizza O
houses O
on O
Moscow O
pr O
224 O
visited O
the O
last O
time O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
were O
satisfied, O
so O
on O
the O
old O
memory O
and O
came O
again, O
but..... O
waited O
15 O
minutes O
until O
the O
waiter O
goes, O
ура, O
the O
waiter O
came, O
we O
ordered O
Greeks, O
beer, O
salad O
Caesar O
and O
pizza. O

The O
Greeks O
carried O
about O
20min, O
not O
reaching O
a O
little O
bit O
to O
our O
table O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
ruined O
them O
on O
the O
floor..... O
then O
again O
waited O
for O
the O
Greeks O
and O
here O
they O
were O
brought O
with O
a O
warm O
beer, B-TARGET
then O
brought O
Caesar O
salad, O
I O
think O
we O
all O
know O
how O
it O
looks, O
it O
turns O
out O
not. O

The O
salad O
dish O
consisted O
of O
the O
following O
components: O
at O
the O
bottom O
lay O
4 O
large O
pieces O
(not O
pieces) O
cut O
from O
the O
baguette, O
above O
the O
leaves O
of O
the O
salad, O
then O
a O
little O
tomato O
and O
4 O
large O
strips O
of O
chicken, O
the O
parmesan B-TARGET
was O
not O
at O
all, O
cool? O

Then O
they O
brought O
a O
pizza B-TARGET
- O
probably O
it O
was O
made O
of O
rubber. O

It O
is O
worth O
all O
this O
"pleasantness" O
not O
cheap, O
service.... O
yes, O
I O
forgot O
to O
drink O
that O
there O
was O
still O
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
the O
truth O
is O
that O
the O
musician B-TARGET
frankly O
falsified. O

It O
becomes O
scary O
that O
fewer O
and O
fewer O
decent O
restaurants O
remain O
in O
Peter. O

We O
will O
never O
come O
to O
this O
institution B-TARGET
again. O

They O
entered O
this O
cafe O
completely O
by O
chance, O
without O
finding O
a O
suitable O
restaurant O
nearby! O

The O
interior B-TARGET
cafe O
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
we O
decided O
to O
stay O
so-called O
"without O
looking O
at O
the O
menu". O

the O
next O
day O
came O
with O
friends, O
they O
were O
also O
delighted! O

The O
advantages O
of O
the O
café O
are: O
1) O
tasty O
kitchen B-TARGET
2) O
affordable O
prices O
3) O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET

To O
the O
downside: O
location B-TARGET
(located O
in O
the O
yard), O
but O
personally O
it O
doesn't O
strain O
me O
much! O

They O
met O
in O
this O
pub O
with O
a O
friend. O

The O
case O
was O
on O
Thursday, O
the O
day. O

At O
first O
there O
were O
few O
visitors, O
but O
the O
closer O
the O
evening, O
the O
more O
the O
bar O
filled. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
in O
the O
hall O
was O
not O
smoked, O
to O
see O
a O
good O
and O
well-designed O
ventilation B-TARGET
system. O

Pleasant, O
quite O
cozy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
in O
the O
style O
of O
pub. O

Very O
good O
menu, B-TARGET
but O
everything O
is O
very O
nutritious, O
delicious. O

And O
big O
portions B-TARGET
that O
can O
not O
not O
not O
like O
men. O

My O
friend O
has O
been O
here O
much O
more O
often O
than O
I, O
says O
that O
she O
has O
tried O
almost O
everything, O
and O
she O
likes O
it. O

The O
opioid B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
quickly O
served O
us, O
reacted O
very O
quickly O
to O
my O
funny O
comment O
about O
something O
light O
and O
low-calorie O
and O
offered O
several O
dishes, O
although O
I O
was O
not O
going O
to O
follow O
a O
strict O
diet O
or O
any O
restrictions O
in O
the O
food. O

In O
general, O
she O
answered O
all O
the O
questions O
immediately O
and O
comprehensively, O
which O
is O
very O
pleasant. O

She O
may O
or O
may O
not O
always O
have O
responded O
promptly O
to O
our O
requests, O
but O
she O
did O
her O
job O
well. O

A O
little O
surprise O
- O
on O
this O
day O
there O
was O
a O
very O
small O
range B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
beer. I-TARGET

But O
since O
I O
was O
driving, O
I O
was O
all O
right, O
and O
my O
friend O
helped O
to O
make O
the O
right O
choice O
and O
she O
was O
satisfied. O

The O
result: O
the O
pub B-TARGET
liked O
it. O

If O
there O
are O
any O
meetings O
in O
this O
area O
or O
just O
want O
to O
eat O
- O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
there O
again. O

I O
am O
happy O
to O
leave O
a O
new O
review O
about O
Puri! B-TARGET

Since O
my O
first O
visit O
it O
has O
been O
quite O
a O
long O
time, O
during O
which O
I O
have O
repeatedly O
been O
in O
the O
restaurant O
- O
at O
first O
it O
was O
caused O
by O
purely O
objective O
circumstances O
- O
convenient O
location O
to O
the O
house, O
but O
with O
each O
time O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
left O
the O
best O
and O
the O
best O
impression. O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
very O
attentive, O
even O
when O
the O
restaurant O
is O
fully O
loaded, O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
is O
always O
in O
the O
area O
of O
visibility; O
he O
can O
always O
tell O
what O
the O
dish O
is; O
everything O
is O
carried O
out/cleaned O
on O
time. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
say O
a O
special O
thank O
you O
to O
a O
young B-TARGET
man I-TARGET
- O
my O
name O
is O
Ilya O
- O
a O
young O
man! O

The O
food B-TARGET
remained O
satisfied O
each O
time O
- O
salads B-TARGET
always O
from O
fresh O
vegetables, O
insanely O
tasty O
хачапури, B-TARGET
very O
decent O
лагман. B-TARGET

A O
decent O
wine B-TARGET
card I-TARGET
- O
"so O
myself O
wines" B-TARGET
is O
not. O

Already O
for O
a O
long O
time O
brings O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
in O
the O
form O
of O
Airan O
- O
who O
loves O
this O
drink, O
will O
appreciate. O

In O
general, O
young O
people O
- O
long O
ago O
and O
for O
5+ O
corrected O
the O
unforeseen O
period O
of O
opening. O

And O
now O
I O
can O
definitely O
say O
that O
it O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
the O
south-west O
edge O
of O
our O
city. O

I O
will O
continue O
to O
come O
to O
you O
for O
lunches O
and O
dinners. O

By O
the O
way, O
and O
with O
parking B-TARGET
became O
better. O

I O
was O
recently O
with O
my O
wife O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
nice, O
but O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
could O
be O
even O
faster. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
nice O
without O
any O
excesses O
everything O
in O
a O
strict O
style. O

We O
ordered O
chestnuts, O
salad O
and O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine. O

Let O
me O
say O
that O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
simply O
amazing O
everything O
brought O
quickly, O
and O
the O
main O
thing O
is O
delicious. O

I O
just O
often O
go O
to O
restaurants O
and O
order O
mostly O
ham O
(if O
there O
is) O
and O
salad O
restaurant, O
and O
I O
have O
something O
to O
compare, O
I O
will O
say O
that O
salad B-TARGET
is O
worth O
your O
money, O
and O
ham O
too, O
and O
here O
the O
bar B-TARGET
is O
a O
bit O
expensive. O

It O
took O
a O
long O
time, O
perhaps O
the O
officials B-TARGET
thought O
that O
we O
would O
sit O
down O
and O
have O
something O
else, O
but O
this O
did O
not O
strain O
us O
very O
much, O
as O
we O
wanted O
romance O
around O
the O
Gulf O
of O
Finland. O

To O
be O
honest, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
romantically O
and O
most O
importantly O
delicious, O
this O
is O
the O
place. B-TARGET

It O
is O
true O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
season O
and O
on O
the O
street O
we O
did O
not O
sit O
(cold) O
but O
unfortunately. O

I O
hope O
next O
summer O
we O
will O
definitely O
come O
there O
and O
sit O
together O
with O
my O
wife O
in O
a O
romantic O
environment. B-TARGET

I O
wish O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
success O
and O
prosperity. O

Earlier, O
they O
used O
to O
go O
to O
EVRAZия O
GOLD O
on O
the O
Little O
Posadskaya. O

Of O
course, O
not O
on O
DR:) O

But O
once O
I O
was O
at O
the O
guests O
at O
the O
wedding O
(I O
almost O
did O
not O
eat O
there, O
so O
I O
will O
tell O
about O
my O
visits O
just O
"to O
eat"). O

What O
attracts O
GOLD? O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
during O
the O
frequent O
visit O
good O
relations O
with O
the O
waiters O
were O
established O
and O
therefore O
there O
were O
no O
problems O
with O
service... B-TARGET

From O
the O
food O
I O
almost O
always O
eat O
and O
drink O
one O
and O
the O
same: O
meat O
soup O
(it's O
hard O
to O
spoil O
it, O
it's O
almost O
the O
same O
thing), O
Philadelphia O
- O
unlike O
other O
restaurants O
in O
the O
network, O
the O
roll O
is O
big O
and O
very O
delicious, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
judge, O
all O
the O
products O
fresh O
(where O
the O
dried O
rice O
gets O
in O
the O
dryers, O
but O
here O
with O
this O
ok:)))) O
2 O
of O
my O
favorite O
dishes O
- O
Baked O
Midi O
(not O
so O
often O
I O
order O
them O
in O
other O
places, O
but O
as O
huge O
and O
delicious O
as O
in O
Gold, O
I've O
never O
seen O
anywhere) O
and O
Minari O
(sweet O
roll O
with O
banana O
and O
chocolate, O
too O
very O
delicious). O

I O
always O
advise O
everyone. O

I O
don't O
know O
how O
now, O
but O
2 O
months O
ago O
when O
ordering O
MOCHITO O
asked O
- O
big O
or O
small. O

I O
can O
say O
that O
the O
Big O
is O
practically O
a O
heart:))) O

Very O
tasty O
regular O
mochito. B-TARGET

I O
can't O
speak O
for O
the O
whole O
kitchen. O

But O
according O
to O
my O
subjective O
impressions O
- O
my O
4 O
favorite O
dishes B-TARGET
and O
Mohito B-TARGET
in O
Gould O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city! O

We O
were O
at O
this O
restaurant O
on O
the O
weekend. O

We O
really O
liked O
both O
the O
menu, B-TARGET
and O
the O
service, B-TARGET
and O
the O
overall O
atmosphere. B-TARGET

Behind O
such O
a O
stylish, O
interesting O
interior B-TARGET
and O
a O
very O
varied O
menu B-TARGET
hides O
hospitality B-TARGET
and O
respect, O
not O
a O
drop O
of O
paphos O
and O
unjustified O
prices, O
and O
quality O
corresponds O
to O
the O
gift. B-TARGET

In O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
weekend O
we O
freely O
chose O
from O
several O
tables, O
the O
live B-TARGET
music I-TARGET
was O
just O
wonderful, O
hateful O
and O
extremely O
harmoniously O
chosen O
repertoire. B-TARGET

The O
menu O
really O
made O
me B-TARGET
choose O
for O
a O
long O
time, O
not O
because O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
choose O
from, O
but O
because O
I O
wanted O
to O
try O
a O
lot O
of O
things. O

The O
ordered O
dishes B-TARGET
were O
both O
delicious B-TARGET
and O
delicious, O
it O
was O
rabbit B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
nuts I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
ravioli B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
salmon I-TARGET
and O
basil B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
- O
all O
very O
delicious. O

Sorry, O
we O
didn't O
get O
to O
the O
desserts, O
were O
served:) O

It O
was O
very O
nice O
to O
be O
here, O
we O
hope O
to O
spend O
time O
in O
this O
place O
many O
times:) O

P.s. O
bananas B-TARGET
baked I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
tomatoes I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
are O
simply O
magical O
:) O

Thank O
you O
very O
much! O

We O
wish O
you O
to O
remain O
the O
same O
and O
original O
:) O

Hello O
everyone! O

This O
week O
visited O
with O
a O
friend O
Cafe O
and O
seductive O
name O
appetite) O

At O
the O
entrance O
we O
immediately O
met O
a O
smiling O
girl, B-TARGET
asked O
where O
we O
would O
like O
to O
eat O
and O
gave O
a O
menu. O

Interior B-TARGET
very O
comfortable, O
comfortable O
sofas, B-TARGET
quiet O
music B-TARGET
) O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
came O
almost O
immediately, O
advised O
to O
try O
Sakura O
desserts O
and O
club O
tea!) O

I O
didn't O
have O
to O
wait O
long, O
brought O
everything O
quickly, O
which O
is O
very O
delightful O
when O
ordering O
a O
sweater) O

One O
of O
the O
best O
places B-TARGET
in O
terms O
of O
price O
and O
quality, O
we O
must O
go O
further O
to O
try O
the O
dishes O
with O
the O
original O
names) O

We O
went O
to O
this O
establishment B-TARGET
to O
eat O
based O
on O
good O
reviews O
on O
various O
sites. O

They O
had O
dinner O
with O
their O
husband. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
fully O
equipped O
to O
receive O
food. O

I O
have O
a O
positive O
attitude O
towards O
IKEA B-TARGET
furniture I-TARGET
rather O
than O
a O
negative O
one))) O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
quite O
prompt O
and O
attentive. O

True, O
as O
someone O
here O
has O
already O
written, O
for O
some O
reason O
there O
were O
always O
different O
approaches... O
Strange O
approach. O

Now, O
as O
far O
as O
the O
kitchen O
is O
concerned: O
first O
I O
wanted O
to O
order O
a O
pastry, O
but O
as O
it O
turned O
out, O
that O
half B-TARGET
a I-TARGET
serving I-TARGET
can O
not O
be O
taken, O
and O
the O
whole O
serving B-TARGET
up O
to O
500 O
grams, O
which O
for O
me O
to O
eat O
is O
simply O
unrealistic))) O

Not O
all O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
can O
quietly O
hide O
a O
pack B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
pasta, I-TARGET
it O
is O
worth O
thinking O
about O
the O
fragile O
girls O
of O
customers! O

I O
had O
to O
take O
soup. O

I O
chose O
cream O
soup O
from O
broccoli, O
which O
I O
love O
very O
much. O

But O
hey O
soup, B-TARGET
than O
here O
I O
never O
ate. O

I O
didn't O
think O
that O
it O
could O
be O
spoiled O
like O
this: O
it O
smelled O
of O
burning O
skins B-TARGET
(I O
like O
salo O
in O
principle, O
but O
in O
my O
understanding O
salo O
is O
not O
a O
place O
in O
broccoli O
cream O
soup) O
and O
not O
only O
smelled((( O

I O
had O
to O
eat O
bread O
with O
oil O
and O
bed O
at O
my O
husband's O
ordered O
lasagna, B-TARGET
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
was O
quite O
nice. O

My O
husband O
stayed O
quite O
satisfied, O
I O
left O
also O
not O
hungry O
(the O
bread B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty))))) O

Maybe O
I O
just O
wasn't O
lucky, O
but O
I O
made O
the O
conclusion O
for O
myself O
that O
I O
won't O
go O
there O
anymore. O

I O
have O
been O
visiting O
this O
institution O
since O
it O
was O
called O
"Sushi O
House". O

The O
menu O
has O
changed O
a O
little O
with O
the O
name O
change, O
no O
more O
changes O
have O
been O
noticed. O

Very O
pleasant O
place, B-TARGET
very O
quiet O
(provided O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
room), O
tables O
at O
a O
distance O
from O
each O
other, O
so O
if O
you O
sit O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
you O
people O
can O
still O
talk O
and O
eat O
quietly O
without O
listening O
to O
other O
people's O
conversations. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
pleasant, O
nothing O
particularly O
impressive O
except O
(of O
course!) O
toilet. O
=) O

The O
food O
is O
prepared O
quickly O
and O
brought O
quickly. O

There O
was O
never O
a O
hot O
one O
waiting O
for O
more O
than O
half O
an O
hour. O

The O
girls B-TARGET
are O
very O
nice, O
welcoming, O
always O
help O
to O
point O
out. O

Of O
particular O
dishes O
I O
can O
mention O
salmon B-TARGET
cream I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
and O
salad B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
seafood. I-TARGET

Very O
tasty! O

Several O
times O
she O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
in O
a O
narrow O
family O
circle. O

A O
flower O
lantern O
is O
always O
brought O
by O
themselves O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
see O
that O
the O
visitor O
has O
come O
with O
flowers. O

It's O
nice. O

Every O
time O
they O
went O
out, O
they O
were O
very O
satisfied. O

My O
favorite O
droughts B-TARGET
in O
the O
city. O

We've O
been O
there O
and O
we'll O
never O
go O
again! O

Horrible O
service! B-TARGET

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
so O
self-sufficient, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
as O
much O
as O
written O
in O
the O
menu. O

And O
as O
far O
as O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
concerned, O
it O
is O
completely O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
name. O

We O
came O
there O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday O
of O
a O
friend. O

It O
started O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
were O
approached O
by O
a O
hamlet O
waiter B-TARGET
- O
a O
trainee O
who O
does O
not O
know O
the O
elementary O
things O
that O
make O
up O
the O
dish... O

Then O
in O
a O
half-empty O
restaurant O
we O
waited O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
for O
our O
order. O

What O
we O
ate O
did O
not O
cause O
any O
pleasure, O
drinks B-TARGET
only O
more O
or O
less, O
but O
it O
also O
did O
not O
encourage O
to O
leave O
even O
10 O
hours O
for O
tea... O

We O
were O
very O
unhappy! O

We O
will O
not O
go O
there O
anymore O
and O
we O
will O
not O
recommend O
to O
friends! O

This O
place B-TARGET
has O
left O
a O
ambiguous O
view. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
interesting O
interior, B-TARGET
nice O
kitchen B-TARGET
(they O
ordered O
bread B-TARGET
and O
wine), B-TARGET
but O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
(sorry, O
did O
not O
remember O
the O
name) O
drove O
us O
by O
the O
order. O

And O
it O
was O
so. O

We O
came O
in O
the O
day, O
after O
lunch, O
there O
were O
almost O
no O
people O
in O
the O
hall, O
so O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
immediately O
approached O
us. O

I O
accepted O
the O
order O
and O
disappeared! O

Waited O
for O
2 O
bottles O
of O
wine O
for O
20 O
minutes, O
then O
another O
paste O
for O
25... O

At O
the O
same O
time O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us O
very O
strangely O
when O
we O
came O
to O
find O
out O
about O
the O
hot. O

But O
with O
whom O
it O
is O
not O
possible, O
we O
thought O
and O
did O
not O
make O
a O
mistake, O
because O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
appeared O
and O
apologized. O

And O
then O
there O
was O
the O
show! O

He O
suddenly O
began O
to O
come O
up O
every O
5 O
minutes O
(when O
we O
were O
eating) O
and O
talk O
about O
the O
show O
program O
that O
would O
take O
place O
in O
the O
evening. O

After O
the O
words O
"We O
will O
definitely O
come" O
he O
left O
and O
appeared O
again O
with O
a O
new O
portion O
of O
information. O

After O
the O
third O
approach O
I O
couldn't O
stand O
and O
asked O
"You O
don't O
have O
anyone O
to O
talk O
to? O
and O
what O
about O
the O
bartender?" O
we O
got O
absolutely O
sincerely O
"she's O
got O
a O
sms O
today!". O

It O
is O
good O
that O
we O
have O
already O
eaten O
to O
the O
moment O
of O
this O
masterful O
answer. O

They O
asked O
for O
an O
account. O

They O
settled O
down O
and O
decided O
to O
replace O
this O
gentleman O
no O
longer O
come:) O

We O
go O
there O
with O
our O
husband O
periodically. O

Very!!! O
I O
like O
hot, O
with O
crispy O
little O
doughnuts. B-TARGET

There O
are O
3 O
pieces: O
rye, O
wheat O
and O
mixed. O

To O
them O
sometimes O
bring O
butter O
))) O

By O
the O
time O
they O
bring O
the O
snacks, O
the O
sandwiches B-TARGET
from O
the O
table O
are O
gone: O
we O
can't O
just O
look O
at O
them, O
they O
are O
very O
tasty. O

I O
have O
read O
the O
review O
about O
хачапури B-TARGET
с I-TARGET
сыром, I-TARGET
and O
already O
want O
to O
try, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
it O
will O
be O
uncomfortable! O

I O
can O
never O
refrain O
from O
ordering O
baked B-TARGET
sweets I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
butter I-TARGET
sauce, I-TARGET
which O
are O
served O
on O
a O
large O
plate O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
sea O
salt. O

And O
also O
I O
never O
give O
up O
the O
ham B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
rabbit O
on O
the O
skirt!!! O

The B-TARGET
shell I-TARGET
is O
unusual, O
as O
is O
the O
sauce B-TARGET
to O
it. O

And O
what O
is O
very O
pleasant O
- O
to O
the O
chessboard O
bring O
a O
plate B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
water I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
lemon I-TARGET
to O
kiss O
hands: O
I O
like O
to O
eat O
chessboard O
with O
my O
hands. O

The O
husband O
usually O
orders O
a O
fish B-TARGET
from O
which O
he O
is O
always O
delighted!!! O

Here O
is O
delicious!! O

Recommend. O

The O
interior O
is O
not O
particularly O
pleasurable: O
there O
is O
the O
impression O
that O
the O
idea O
from O
the O
90s O
of O
the O
last O
century... O
but O
it O
does O
not O
prevent O
a O
good O
time O
spent O
in O
this O
establishment. O

The O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
windows O
will O
add O
positive O
emotions. O

Service O
staff B-TARGET
does O
not O
cause O
complaints, O
but O
do O
not O
always O
want O
to O
bear O
luck O
))) O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant! B-TARGET

Excellent O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
delicious O
dishes! B-TARGET

But O
there O
is O
one O
NO-year O
ago O
in O
this O
restaurant O
worked O
absolutely O
different O
staff B-TARGET
(other O
waiters, O
administrator). O

The O
group O
that O
was O
before, O
I O
liked O
much O
more! O

The O
staff O
knew O
the O
menu O
from O
and O
before, O
could O
advise O
and O
tell O
you O
about O
each O
dish O
in O
detail, O
accepted O
the O
order O
without O
recording O
it, O
remembered O
absolutely O
everything! O

They O
were O
mindlessly O
attentive, O
kind O
and O
welcoming! O

After O
the O
staff B-TARGET
changed, O
we O
often O
confused O
the O
dishes O
that O
I O
ordered O
brought O
something O
completely O
different, O
something O
and O
completely O
forgotten. O

The O
child O
somehow O
spilled O
the O
cocktail, O
so O
we O
could O
not O
reach O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
for O
5 O
minutes O
and O
wiped O
out O
as O
much O
as O
we O
could! O

And O
that O
they O
know O
little O
about O
their O
dishes, O
I O
don't O
say O
anymore! O

The O
food B-TARGET
remained O
the O
same O
delicious... O

Previously O
I O
had O
nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
and O
I O
visited O
it O
once O
a O
week O
exactly! O

But O
now O
there O
is O
no O
such O
huge O
desire. O

If O
I O
knew O
the O
place O
where O
the O
previous O
band O
moved, O
I O
would O
visit O
it O
sooner... O

Excellent O
establishment. B-TARGET

He O
traveled O
with O
his O
girlfriend O
on O
Kрестovsky, O
decided O
to O
go O
sit O
down O
to O
drink O
coffee. O

The O
girl O
liked O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
very O
much O
(it O
is O
her O
favorite O
dessert, B-TARGET
she O
said O
it O
was O
cooked O
perfectly). O

I O
ordered O
myself O
a B-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
salad, I-TARGET
quite O
tasty, O
although O
I O
like O
more O
calorie O
food O
:). O

The B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
is O
normal, O
the O
officials B-TARGET
know O
their O
job. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
anything O
about O
the O
interior, B-TARGET
because O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
it, O
but O
it O
seems O
that O
everything O
is O
made O
in O
French O
style. O

Excellent O
restaurant! B-TARGET

I O
searched O
for O
an O
eastern O
and O
not O
very O
expensive O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
found O
it! O

The O
wedding O
was O
celebrated O
on O
May O
21, O
and O
there O
were O
not O
many O
people. O

The O
pleasant O
administrator B-TARGET
Olga O
immediately O
offered O
the O
VIP B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
which O
is O
the O
most O
pleasant, O
for O
it O
there O
is O
no O
separate O
fee. O

They O
came O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised, O
the O
tables O
were O
not O
empty, O
salads B-TARGET
are O
all O
delicious, O
special O
attention O
wants O
to O
be O
paid O
to O
steak, B-TARGET
about O
that O
something! O

All O
my O
guests O
were O
very O
satisfied, O
by O
the O
way O
about O
the O
steak B-TARGET
remember O
everyone O
who O
ate O
it O
:) O

The O
spirits O
were O
allowed O
to O
bring O
a O
special O
one, O
but O
there O
too O
we O
bought O
a O
little. O

All O
very-very O
liked! O

Toilets B-TARGET
are O
nice, O
in O
mirrors, O
and O
in O
men's O
water O
runs O
on O
the O
wall O
(husband O
said O
so) O

And O
Kalian B-TARGET
is O
really O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city! O

All O
here!!!! O

And O
this O
is O
not O
advertising, O
really O
here O
very O
cozy O
and O
delicious O
and O
just O
pleasantly O
located, O
new O
interior B-TARGET
solutions. O

Recently O
visited O
the O
restaurant O
"MASSMИДия" O
with O
her O
husband, O
and O
not O
for O
the O
first O
time. O

Honestly, O
after O
the O
visit, O
still O
some O
time O
came O
in O
shock. O

horror. O

Mass, B-TARGET
what O
happened O
to O
you??? O

Where O
did O
the O
friendly O
staff O
and O
the O
almost O
perfect O
service O
come O
from? O

At O
first O
it O
seemed O
nothing, O
met O
and O
planted, O
and O
here O
it O
all O
began, O
my O
husband O
brought O
a O
dish O
more O
than O
me, O
everything O
could O
be O
nothing, O
if O
not O
the O
answer O
of O
the O
waiter: B-TARGET
"Well O
sorry, O
how O
prepared O
"....... O
(in O
general O
the O
service B-TARGET
leaves O
to O
wish O
for O
the O
best) O

And O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dinner O
about O
us O
and O
completely O
forgotten. O

It O
is O
more O
interesting O
for O
the B-TARGET
waiters I-TARGET
to O
communicate O
with O
the O
bartender O
and O
the O
manager O
than O
with O
the O
guests O
of O
their O
restaurant. O

Mass O
Media O
teach O
your O
staff, B-TARGET
because O
it O
is O
a O
guarantee O
of O
success. O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
evening O
is O
spoiled. O

If O
and O
it O
is O
worth O
to O
go O
there, O
then O
exclusively O
on O
favorite O
media, B-TARGET
and O
then O
swiftly O
run O
away O
from O
there, O
until O
the O
greedy O
staff B-TARGET
absolutely O
did O
not O
give O
up O
the O
desire, O
at O
least O
on O
them O
to O
run!!!! O

Honestly, O
we O
will O
no O
longer O
come, O
and O
others O
do O
not O
advise. O

And O
what O
was O
the O
beginning!? O

Who O
loves O
delicious O
food, B-TARGET
come O
to O
Diana, B-TARGET
do O
not O
regret. O

On O
the O
other O
day O
we O
celebrated O
another O
birthday O
with O
our O
colleagues O
and O
all O
of O
us O
liked O
this O
place B-TARGET
very O
much. O

Since O
there O
are O
many O
birthdays O
in O
the O
year, O
we O
have O
visited O
almost O
all O
similar O
establishments O
near O
Senna O
and O
can O
quite O
compare O
them. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
in O
Diane O
is O
not O
inferior O
to O
the O
First O
Rubber, O
although O
the O
prices O
are O
noticeably O
lower. O

Cocktails O
were O
made O
at O
our O
request, O
although O
they O
are O
not O
on O
the O
menu. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
also O
at O
a O
high O
level! O

Of O
the O
small O
downsides O
- O
long O
cooked O
hot O
(it O
should O
be O
remembered O
and O
ordered O
immediately) O
and O
Mohito B-TARGET
turned O
out O
uncommon O
- O
with O
caramel O
and O
too O
sweet O
taste O

Guests O
visited O
this O
restaurant, O
celebrated O
birthday. O

The B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
helpful. O

We O
ordered O
salads O
and O
second O
dishes O
in O
advance, O
making O
a O
prepayment O
and O
the O
manager O
promised O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
ready O
for O
our O
arrival. O

They O
came O
- O
we O
as O
a O
Buddhist O
did O
not O
wait. O

The O
ship O
left O
the O
harbor, O
and O
the O
table O
was O
not O
covered. O

The O
second O
was O
delivered O
when O
the O
locomotive O
returned. O

In O
general, O
the O
hotel O
managed O
to O
eat O
the O
ordered O
dishes. O

Now O
about O
the O
kitchen O
- O
small O
portions, B-TARGET
meat B-TARGET
is O
hard, O
and O
prices O
are O
high O
for O
such O
food. B-TARGET

I O
was O
uncomfortable O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guests, O
the O
poor O
service B-TARGET
was O
aggravated O
by O
the O
wonderful O
view B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the O
window O
and O
pleasant O
interior. B-TARGET

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
several O
times. O

I O
can't O
say O
I'm O
a O
gourmet, O
but O
I O
liked O
the O
cuisine. B-TARGET

The O
fact O
is O
that O
I O
don't O
eat O
sushi O
and O
rolls, O
but O
I O
eat O
meat, O
and O
soup O
would O
be O
taken O
at O
least O
for O
business O
lunch. O

In O
short, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
go O
here O
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
the O
second B-TARGET
and O
salads, B-TARGET
for O
them O
things O
are O
done O
perfectly. O

Meat B-TARGET
is O
a O
huge O
choice, O
and O
salads O
with O
vegetables, O
chicken, O
meat, O
etc. O

That O
is, O
everything O
like O
I O
love. O

Concerning O
the O
environment B-TARGET
- O
yes, O
it O
is O
standard, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
Theme O
Lebedev, O
and O
therefore O
megadesign O
findings O
I O
am O
not O
interested, O
I O
have O
come O
here, O
not O
design O
to O
see. O

The O
same O
applies O
to O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
waiters. O

The O
people O
have O
little O
and O
it's O
great. O

Smoking B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
separately, O
because O
it O
was O
not O
stressful. O

On O
service B-TARGET
- O
100% O
agree O
to O
the O
opinion O
that O
depends O
on O
change. O

There O
were O
those O
who O
served O
on O
9, O
and O
there O
were O
those O
who O
served O
on O
1 O
(with O
whom O
they O
were O
immediately O
reconciled). O

For O
desserts O
- O
usually O
took O
ice B-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
it O
is O
certainly O
delicious, O
but O
we O
near O
the O
house O
exactly O
the O
same O
weight O
is O
sold, O
i.e. O
nothing O
special. O

Restaurant O
on O
Energy. O

We O
went O
with O
a O
young O
man, O
no O
waiter B-TARGET
looked O
at O
us! O

They O
settled O
on O
an O
independently O
chosen O
table. O

Ten O
minutes O
wait O
for O
the O
waiter. B-TARGET

Didn't O
wait... O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
menu O
myself. O

Another O
15 O
minutes O
of O
waiting...the O
waiter B-TARGET
came. O

It's O
worse. O

In O
the O
meantime O
we O
waited O
for O
the O
order O
managed O
to O
serve O
two O
pairs. O

If O
honestly O
wanted O
to O
leave, O
but O
apparently O
wanted O
to O
have O
more, O
stayed. O

No O
pleasure O
from O
the O
visit. O

Quickly O
brought O
only O
the O
account... O

There O
if O
only O
for O
cheap O
promotions O
to O
go, O
but O
something O
card O
do O
not O
want O
to O
buy, O
yet O
you O
expect O
positive O
emotions O
from O
visiting O
such O
institutions B-TARGET
for O
any O
money. O

This O
pub B-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
watch O
football! O

Many O
screens, B-TARGET
conveniently O
located. O

Pleasant O
musical B-TARGET
accompaniment. I-TARGET

This O
place O
has O
provoked O
associations O
with O
the O
restaurant O
:) O

Good O
choice O
of O
delicious O
beer. B-TARGET

The B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
deserves O
attention. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
quality, O
delicious. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
is O
nice, O
especially, O
the O
pardon, O
in O
the O
ladies B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
very O
liked O
(excellent O
sports O
audibility. O
broadcasts O
noted O
not O
only O
by O
me O
:D) O

But O
it O
is O
worth O
working O
on O
the O
professionalism O
of O
the O
staff. B-TARGET

There O
was O
a O
case, O
ordered O
salads, O
waited O
long, O
in O
general O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
forgot O
about O
them O
what, O
had O
to O
worry O
the O
young O
man O
serving O
the O
neighboring O
table, O
the O
situation O
was O
fixed, O
came O
another O
waiter, B-TARGET
already O
without O
complaints O
fulfilled O
its O
duties. O

There O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
there O
were O
very O
few O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
the O
whole O
hall. O

I O
wish O
Finnegans O
prosperity, O
a O
good O
place. B-TARGET

I O
will O
tell O
a O
wonderful O
story O
about O
how O
in O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Troika" I-TARGET
are O
valued O
by O
customers. O

My O
friend O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
her O
birthday O
at O
this O
place. O
so O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
day O
of O
celebration O
coincided O
with O
the O
cannon O
of O
the O
Easter O
holiday. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
empty! O
(the O
table O
was O
booked O
for O
7 O
pm) O

But, O
open O
on O
the O
occasion O
of O
birthday O
:) O

I O
don't O
have O
any O
claims, O
everything O
is O
perfect! O

As O
a O
person O
who O
does O
not O
eat O
meat O
and O
birds, O
it O
is O
difficult O
for O
me O
to O
make O
an O
order. O

That O
day O
hot O
fish O
dishes O
did O
not O
attract O
my O
attention. O

I O
ordered O
a O
hot O
vegetable O
snack. O

To O
be O
honest, O
I O
did O
not O
like O
it O
very O
much O
(it O
is O
only O
because O
of O
the O
way O
of O
cooking, O
vegetables O
after O
thermal O
processing O
lose O
brightness), O
the O
main O
thing, O
it O
was O
amazingly O
delicious, O
considering O
that O
by O
the O
time O
the O
dish B-TARGET
was O
served O
I O
was O
no O
longer O
hungry. O

It O
was O
the O
second O
time O
in O
my O
life O
that O
I O
ate O
with O
such O
appetite. O

The O
winery O
of O
the O
celebration O
was O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
attention O
from O
the O
restaurant O
and O
dessert O
from O
the O
establishment) O

I O
can't O
pass O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
artists. B-TARGET

Beautiful, O
professional O
(unfortunately O
not O
in O
my O
taste O
such O
shows, O
mostly O
with O
great O
interest O
looked O
at O
the O
decorations O
and O
costumes). O

Already O
decided O
to O
visit O
this O
place B-TARGET
periodically. O

Thank O
you O
restaurant B-TARGET
"Troika" I-TARGET
for O
excellent O
impressions! O

I O
express O
my O
gratitude O
from O
the O
whole O
family O
to O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
team I-TARGET
for O
organizing O
the O
work O
on O
the O
celebration O
of O
my O
mother's O
birthday! O

From O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
our O
communication O
it O
became O
clear O
that O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
trust O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
employees I-TARGET
to O
carry O
out O
such O
an O
important O
event O
for O
us. O

Various O
menu B-TARGET
options, I-TARGET
guest O
boarding O
options O
have O
been O
proposed. O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
event O
the O
guests O
and O
the O
widow O
were O
greeted O
friendlyly, O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
we O
are O
very O
much O
waiting O
here. O

According O
to O
the O
guests' O
reviews, O
and O
in O
our O
opinion O
- O
the O
restaurant's O
cuisine B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
(thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
chef)! I-TARGET

Beautiful O
dishes, B-TARGET
decoration, B-TARGET
delivery, B-TARGET
well O
and O
of O
course, O
taste B-TARGET
- O
all O
at O
a O
high O
level. O

The O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
waiters O
was O
unnoticed, O
the O
dishes O
and O
dishes O
changed O
as O
if O
by O
themselves. O

We O
cannot O
fail O
to O
note O
the O
work B-TARGET
of O
the O
manager O
Alexander. O

Thanks O
to O
him, O
our O
holiday O
became O
just O
a O
holiday, O
not O
a O
care O
for O
guests O
and O
food. O

In O
such O
a O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
want O
to O
come O
back O
again. O

I O
will O
be O
obliged O
to O
advise O
friends O
and O
relatives, O
even O
though O
some O
of O
them O
have O
seen O
everything O
themselves! O

Thank O
you! O

Excellent O
place! B-TARGET

from O

the O
administrator B-TARGET
Anna O
placed O
to O
herself, O
looked O
at O
a O
few O
more O
places O
and O
without O
delay O
decided O
to O
stop O
their O
choice O
at O
this O
relaxing O
cafe. O

Men O
chose O
for O
1550 O
(to O
be O
more O
expensive) O
and O
did O
not O
regret O
how O
much, O
there O
was O
plenty O
of O

everything O
was O
very O
delicious O
and O
beautifully O

arranged, O
no O

All O
our O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
attentive O
when O
picking O
up O
from O
the O

were O
always O
ready, O
agreeing O
with O
us O
when O
to O
serve O
hot O
snacks O
and O
main O
hot O
dishes. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O

we O
all O
took O
something O
the O

something O
the O

Very O

My O

Thank O
you O
Anne O
for O
organizing O
such O
a O
wonderful O
holiday O

On O
April O
17, O
2010, O
a O
family O
lunch O
was O
held. O

You O
have O
chosen O
this O
restaurant O
(a O
short O
cafe). O

And O
they O
did O
not O
complain. O

Since O
we O
did O
not O
have O
any O
special O
requirements O
for O
the O
interior, O
except O
for O
the O
excellent O
view B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
the O
bay, O
we O
got O
what O
we O
wanted. O

The O
music B-TARGET
is O
uncompromising O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
is O
quite O
friendly O
(although O
the O
instruments O
are O
not O
unloaded O
and O
the O
wine O
is O
not O
poured). O

But O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice. O

Thanks O
to O
the B-TARGET
chef! I-TARGET

For O
four O
people O
different O
salads O
and O
hot O
ones O
were O
ordered. O

Portions B-TARGET
are O
large, O
everything O
is O
delicious O
and O
is O
served O
in O
time. O

I O
recommend O
everyone O
who O
after O
the O
walk O
decided O
to O
have O
a O
delicious O
meal. O

Prices O
are O
very O
democratic. O

On O
April O
17, O
I O
visited O
your O
restaurant... O

Even O
from O
the O
street O
noticed O
your O
wonderful O
interior B-TARGET
and O
decided O
to O
have O
dinner O
with O
you... O

The O
first O
thing O
I O
liked O
was O
the O
way O
your O
manager B-TARGET
Ilya O
met O
me, O
just O
like O
I O
love, O
with O
a O
smile O
and O
humor. O

After O
me O
they O
put O
me O
behind O
the O
table O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
that O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
kindly O
took O
my O
top O
clothes O
and O
hung O
them O
in O
the O
wardrobe...(I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
thing O
before). O

Since O
you O
were O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
I O
am O
very O
grateful O
to O
the B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
Valentina O
for O
a O
competent O
explanation O
of O
all O
my O
questions O
about O
the O
menu. O

And O
again O
I O
want O
to O
note O
that O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
very O
positive. O

Valentin O
radiated O
positive O
and O
very O
raised O
my O
mood O
after O
my O
working O
day...(Seeing O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
especially O
in O
the O
evening O
time O
is O
now O
a O
great O
rarity). O

When O
I O
ordered O
the O
dish, O
it O
was O
very O
unexpected O
to O
get O
a O
compliment B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
chef I-TARGET
- O
Pasta O
of O
lamb... O

Who O
cut O
off O
my O
expectation O
of O
my O
ordered O
dishes... O

Fifteen O
minutes O
later O
I O
was O
already O
enjoying O
your O
masterpieces. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
you O
have O
as O
it O
is O
said O
at O
the O
level O
of... O

I O
have O
left O
you O
soaked O
and O
satisfied) O

I O
hope O
your O
staff B-TARGET
is O
always O
as O
positive O
and O
welcoming... O

Young O
people, O
I O
hope O
the O
management O
of O
the O
restaurant O
as O
it O
encourages O
and O
my O
review O
will O
not O
remain O
unnoticed... O

Thank O
you! O

P.S. O
It O
is O
imperative O
to O
return O
to O
you O
again... O

Only O
with O
friends. O

I O
liked O
your O
kitchen B-TARGET
very O
much, O
I O
appreciated O
it O
because O
I O
am O
a O
cook O
myself...) O

Thank O
you O
again! O

We O
visited O
Diana O
on O
04.02.2011 O
(we O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
for O
a O
family O
celebration). O

Strangely O
enough, O
there O
were O
no O
visitors O
except O
us, O
despite O
Friday O
evening. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
girl I-TARGET
met O
us O
very O
kindly O
and O
welcomingly, O
we O
felt O
at O
home O
from O
the O
front O
door. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
was O
very O
pleasant O
- O
solemn, O
sophisticated, O
but O
does O
not O
give O
impetus. O

On O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
bar O
- O
photos O
with O
famous O
guests O
of O
the O
restaurant. O

The O
hall O
is O
small, O
the O
interior B-TARGET
in O
elegant O
red O
and O
blue O
tones, O
which O
creates O
a O
sense O
of O
intimacy O
and O
comfort. O

Decorative B-TARGET
windows I-TARGET
with O
a O
nightscape O
look O
especially O
good! O

The O
menu O
is O
thoughtful O
and O
varied, O
wonderful O
desserts, B-TARGET
there O
are O
excellent O
offers O
of O
festive O
dishes B-TARGET
for O
banquets, O
on O
order O
will O
make O
the O
cake B-TARGET
of O
any O
complexity. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
map I-TARGET
was O
especially O
delighted. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
recommended O
to O
us O
by O
the O
friendly O
host B-TARGET
of O
the O
establishment O
was O
above O
all O
praise! O

In O
general, O
everything O
we O
were O
offered O
for O
dinner B-TARGET
was O
very O
tasty. O

From O
the O
disadvantages O
- O
disappointed O
female O
toilet B-TARGET
(no O
lock O
on O
the O
door O
worked), O
and O
in O
general O
the O
view O
of O
the O
hall B-TARGET
is O
somewhat O
simpler O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
interior. O

In O
general, O
Diana's B-TARGET
visit O
left O
the O
warmest O
memories, O
we O
will O
definitely O
return O
there O
ourselves O
and O
can O
boldly O
recommend O
this O
cosy O
restaurant B-TARGET
for O
both O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
and O
a O
banquet O
for O
30-35 O
people. O

The O
late O
evening...(( O

They O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
their O
husband's O
birthday O
and O
their O
lover's O
day O
(February O
14). O

Booked O
a O
table O
for O
a O
week. O

They O
came O
in O
time, O
didn't O
remember O
us, O
long O
wept O
in O
some O
records, O
urah! O
found O
a O
note O
about O
the O
table O
reserve. O

Villages. O

The O
music B-TARGET
from O
the O
speakers O
at O
first O
was O
just O
loud, O
then O
nothing O
- O
used. O

(Behind O
the O
neighboring O
tables O
the O
couples O
spoke O
loudly O
about O
the O
personal, O
trying O
to O
overhear O
the O
dynamics). O

The O
interior B-TARGET
on O
the O
troika, O
well O
actually O
didn't O
come O
for O
this. O

And O
why? O
- O
right, O
behind O
the O
meat! O

Ordered O
fish O
(590 O
r) O
and O
kare O
(approx. O
600 O
r), O
accompanied O
by O
a O
couple O
of O
beer O
to O
color O
the O
expectation. O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
the O
kitchen O
- O
because O
I O
couldn't O
try O
it O
- O
in O
one O
and O
a O
half O
(!) O
hours O
the O
steaks O
didn't O
bring O
us... O

Did O
not O
bring O
food O
and O
sitting O
next O
to O
other O
guests O
who O
ordered O
at O
the O
same O
time O
with O
us. O

During O
all O
the O
waiting O
time O
came O
to O
us O
only O
twice O
- O
and O
this O
on O
insistence. O

When O
it O
became O
quite O
boring O
asked O
the O
account. O

The O
administrator B-TARGET
came, O
began O
to O
say O
something O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
people O
are O
many O
(pozzala), O
about O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
cook B-TARGET
does O
not O
manage. O

In O
general, O
the O
hungry O
and O
distressed O
have O
left. O

We O
won't O
go O
anymore. O

I O
very O
much O
hope O
that O
the O
rest O
will O
have O
more O
luck. O

Remarkable O
restaurant. B-TARGET

It O
was O
discovered O
by O
accident, O
thanks O
to O
GRUPPON. O

For O
the O
first O
time O
I O
ordered O
a O
table O
for O
my O
birthday O
three O
years O
ago. O

Now O
it O
is O
a O
favorite O
place. B-TARGET

We O
always O
go O
with O
a O
friend O
when O
on O
the O
action. O

The O
room O
was O
very O

Let's O
go O
again O
this O
Saturday. O

Today, O
a O
company O
of O
three O
people O
were O
in O
this O
establishment, O
by O
the O
way O
it O
was O
not O
defined O
cafe O
this O
or O
restaurant, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
the O
idea O
with O
the O
"window B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the O
kitchen" O
is O
simply O
excellent O
and O
seems O
like O
the O
idea O
clearly O
for O
the O
restaurant, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
space O
is O
quite O
small O
("non-smoking O
room O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
kitchen" O
and O
"smoking", O
and O
in O
the O
"smoking" B-TARGET
room I-TARGET
completely O
missing O
stretcher, B-TARGET
I O
even O
imagined O
to O
myself, O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
there O
gathered O
several O
companies O
and O
smoke O
so O
densely, O
you O
have O
to O
open O
a O
window O
from O
which, O
by O
the O
way, O
very O
blows O
- O
to O
cozy O
immediately! O

On O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
: O
Going, O
hoping O
for O
good O
reviews O
on O
the O
kitchen B-TARGET
and O
don't O
be O
mistaken! O

again, O

the O
dough B-TARGET
is O
well O

there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
everything, O
the O
composition O
I O
do O
not O
remember, O
remember O
only O
the O
taste O
- O
excellent! O

On O
the O
interior B-TARGET
: O
In O
general O
it O
is O
quite O
cozy, O
simply, O
to O
play O
the O
light O
would O
somehow, O
and O
also O
to O
fix O
the O
window O
in O
the O
"smoking" B-TARGET
hall, I-TARGET
through O
which O
it O
was O
very O
strongly O
blown, O
about O
the O
absence O
of O

already O
above. O

On O
service B-TARGET

Young, O
not O

but O
very O
kindly, O
I O
like O
such O

quite, O
more O
and O
was O
not O
required. O

They O
were O
there O
three O
times O
at O
the O
end O
of O
January. O

The O
administrator-caisseur-guardman B-TARGET
(in O
one O
face) O
still O
smiled. O

Two O
girls B-TARGET
in O
black O
suits O
torched O
the O
area O
of O
the O
fire O
all O
night O
without O
guiding O
or O
helping O
the O
waiters. B-TARGET

Just O
two O
statues O
with O
a O
boring O
face O
expression. O

Who O
are O
they? O

What O
are O
their O
functions? O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
forgot O
the O
order, O
a O
couple O
of O
minutes O
after O
20 O
came O
and O
asked O
again. O

Then O
half O
an O
hour O
she O
was O
not O
seen O
at O
all. O

At O
the O
end O
we O
ordered O
a O
dessert. O

After O
15 O
minutes, O
they O
found O
out O
that O
the O
panacota O
would O
be O
ready O
in O
40 O
minutes. O

And O
there O
remained O
only O
one O
Tiramisu B-TARGET
(on O
the O
Sabbath O
day O
about O
five). O

After O
coffee O
they O
asked O
for O
an O
account. O

They O
waited O
very O
long, O
as O
the O
girl B-TARGET
(see O
above) O
dressed O
the O
guests. O

She O
brought O
the O
account, O
and O
another O
15 O
minutes O
waited O
for O
the O
payout. O

Three O
hours O
spent O
in O
the O
restaurant, O
of O
which O
2 O
hours O
with O
a O
small O
waiting. O

I O
didn't O
like O
it O
at O
all. O

The O
kitchen B-TARGET
is O
not O
bad, O
but O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small O
for O
not O
small O
prices. O

When O
we O
went O
out, O
our O
husband O
said, O
"The O
snow O
queens O
are O
working O
here." O

Or O
perhaps O
they O
were O
tired, O
or O
perhaps O
they O
all O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
grief? O

I O
don't O
know. O

But O
there O
is O
no O
desire O
to O
come O
there O
anymore. O

P.S. O
Interior B-TARGET
of O
pleasant O
running O
tones. O

But O
the O
sofas B-TARGET
were O
all O
dirty O
(non-smoking O
room)! O

I O
really O
liked O
it! O

They O
were O
greeted O
and O
led O
to O
the O
table. O

The O
menu O
and O
dish O
were O
brought O
quite O
busy. O

Due O
to O
the O
high O
ceilings O
there O
is O
no O
smell O
of O
cigarette B-TARGET
smoke I-TARGET
- O
100 O
points O
only O
for O
this! O

Excellent O
music, B-TARGET
delicious O
food B-TARGET
(especially O
Indian B-TARGET
cuisine). I-TARGET

The O
steak B-TARGET
is O
unprecedented, O
although O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
in O
my O
opinion, O
should O
be O
different. O

From O
the O
downside O
I O
can O
only O
note O
that O
the O
wardrobe B-TARGET
was O
cool O
and O
clothes O
were O
quite O
cold. O

The O
impression O
is O
excellent!!! O

Particularly O
democratic O
was O
the O
account O
- O
pleasantly O
surprised O
:) O

Recommended!!! O

I've O
been O
to O
Daikiri B-TARGET
many O
times O
and O
I O
can O
say O
it's O
the O
best O
bar B-TARGET
in O
the O
city! O

First O
of O
all, O
you O
can O
not O
fail O
to O
note O
the O
cosy O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
the O
bar O
and O
the O
very O
friendly O
and O
welcoming O
staff! B-TARGET

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
factors O
of O
success O
for O
any O
institution! O

The O
cocktails B-TARGET
are O
simply O
wonderful O
and O
what O
is O
especially O
pleasant, O
at O
absolutely O
acceptable O
prices! O

A O
great O
place O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
your O
friends O
and O
enjoy O
delicious O
cocktails! B-TARGET

Yes, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
book O
your O
place O
in O
advance!) O

He O
was O
at O
the O
restaurant O
on O
February O
10th O
on O
coupons, O
company O
of O
5 O
people, O
occasion O
- O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birthday. O

It O
was O
very O
healthy. O

If O
honestly O
I O
don't O
understand O
why O
there O
are O
bad O
reviews O
here, O
maybe O
I'm O
just O
lucky. O

I O
am O
a O
person O
in O
measure O
shy, O
but O
apologize O
absolutely O
for O
nothing, O
I O
will O
talk O
about O
the O
advantages: O

1) O
location B-TARGET
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
city, O
close O
to O
the O
metro O
- O
it O
is O
better O
not O
to O
think O

2) O
the O
interior B-TARGET
is O
very O
pleasant, O
comfortable, O
the O
music B-TARGET
is O
not O
loud O
(although O
sitting O
next O
to O
the O
column), O
the O
player B-TARGET
is O
pleasant O
to O
the O
ear O
( O
lounge O
if O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken) O

3) O
Excellent O
service. B-TARGET

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
(Ilya) O
was O
fun, O
kind O
and O
very O
helpful. O
helpful O
and O
proactive O
(the O
nickname O
did O
not O
pick O
words O
in O
Russian), O
professionally O
helped O
in O
selecting O
the O
menu, O
such O
tea O
leave O
one O
pleasure. O

4) O
Excellent! O
We O
ordered O
both O
Italian B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
Japanese I-TARGET
cuisine, I-TARGET
everyone O
liked O
it. O

5) O
Prices O
are O
not O
cut, O
considering O
that O
it O
is O
the O
center B-TARGET
of O
the O
city O
and O
compared O
with O
other O
dry B-TARGET
bars I-TARGET
=) O

I O
will O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
friends, O
I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
come O
again. O

On O
Saturday O
evening O
they O
went O
to O
celebrate O
the O
birth O
day. O

Vasabi O
was O
in O
a O
hurry, O
wanted O
something O
new, O
went O
to O
this O
establishment O
because O
it O
was O
relatively O
close O
to O
the O
house. O

I O
liked O
the O
food, B-TARGET
but O
not O
all: O
a O
hot O
soup B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
rolled O
up, O
and O
here O
the O
pork B-TARGET
in I-TARGET
the O
sauce O
with O
the O
noodles O
was O
not O
very- O
meat B-TARGET
was O
tasteless, O
tiramisu B-TARGET
tasty- O
rarely O
where O
it O
is O
well O
prepared. O

Excellent O
service, B-TARGET
hateful O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
not O
to O
wait, O
welcoming O
and O
responsive. O

Interior B-TARGET
for O
amateurs. O

The O
place B-TARGET
I O
liked, O
but O
the O
music B-TARGET
played O
very O
loud, O
it O
was O
completely O
not O
heard O
what O
they O
say, O
it O
is O
a O
minus, O
but O
I O
hope O
when O
I O
come O
next O
time O
there O
will O
be O
a O
sweat) O

Come O
on, O
let's O
go O
and O
let's O
go! O

We O
have O
long O
been O
looking O
for O
a O
jazz O
club O
where O
you O
can O
not O
only O
sit O
at O
the O
bar, O
but O
also O
have O
delicious O
meals O
at O
the O
tables O
and O
bite. O

Found. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
desire O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
table O
rather O
than O
at O
the O
bar, O
it O
is O
better O
to O
book O
in O
advance. O

In O
the O
evening O
always O
excellent O
program, B-TARGET
live B-TARGET
music, I-TARGET
jazz. B-TARGET

They O
often O
go O
out O
to O
dance, O
many O
professional O
dancers, O
such O
always O
pleasant O
to O
look O
at. O

There O
are O
walkers O
and O
lovers O
of O
strong O
drinking, O
with O
such, O
of O
course, O
not O
very O
fun O
to O
sit O
next O
to. O

The O
service B-TARGET
is O
always O
good, O
everything O
comes O
quickly. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
always O
delicious. O

They O
ordered O
sardines, O
fish O
and O
meat. O

Good O
wines, B-TARGET
great O
choice. O

Very O
pleasant O
decoration, B-TARGET
cozy O
and O
atmosphere. O

A O
great O
place O
for O
jazz O
and O
live O
music O
lovers! O

Great O
place! B-TARGET

Interior B-TARGET
super, O
very O
comfortable O
cabins B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
soft I-TARGET
pillows. I-TARGET

I O
used O
to O
go O
there O
very O
often O
to O
have O
dinner O
after O
work. O

The O
food B-TARGET
claims O
almost O
once O
was O
not O
all O
delicious, O
except O
that O
vegetables B-TARGET
and O
fruits B-TARGET
could O
be O
of O
better O
quality O
since O
it O
is O
an O
eastern O
restaurant. O

Service B-TARGET
is O
always O
at O
the O
highest O
level. O

Excellent O
place B-TARGET
for O
a O
good O
rest. O

He O
was O
invited O
to O
Amaren, O
where O
a O
friend O
celebrated O
his O
birthday. O

Immediately O
I O
will O
say O
that O
I O
will O
not O
name O
any O
dish O
because O
salads O
and O
meat O
and O
raw O
plates O
have O
already O
been O
ordered, O
and O
hot O
ones O
I O
did O
not O
order, O
but O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
the O
favorite O
from O
the O
plate O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
piece O
of O
steak....mmmm... B-TARGET
liked, O
tasty. O

Salads B-TARGET
and O
snacks B-TARGET
were O
also O
pleasantly O
delighted: O
everything O
was O
beautifully O
decorated O
and O
tastes O
great. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
correct O
is O
the O
salt B-TARGET
cucumbers, I-TARGET
because O
they O
were O
tasteless O
at O
all. O

Our O
company O
was O
accommodated O
behind O
curtains, O
so O
the O
availability O
of O
many O
holidaymakers O
did O
not O
impede O
us O
in O
any O
way. O

It O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
the O
guide O
was O
serving O
us, O
so O
quickly O
the O
dirty B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
disappeared O
from O
the O
table O
and O
drinks O
were O
poured. O

The O
interior B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
cozy, O
very O
pleased O
with O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
separate O
hall B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
karaoke. I-TARGET

We O
walked O
until O
4 O
a.m. O

Thank O
you, O
everything O
was O
fun. O

She O
celebrated O
her O
birthday O
with O
a O
small O
company. O

In O
general O
- O
normal, O
but O
without O
enthusiasm. O

One O
of O
the O
advantages O
is O
the O
interior. B-TARGET

Light O
old O
furniture, B-TARGET
banks B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
composts, I-TARGET
large O
ones, O
interesting. O

I O
liked O
home-made O
drinks. B-TARGET

Hot B-TARGET
meat I-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
- O
delicious, O
but O
small O
portions. B-TARGET

Dessert B-TARGET
Chocolate I-TARGET
crumbs I-TARGET
and O
Philadelphia B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
cake I-TARGET
- O
very-very. O

The O
main O
hall B-TARGET
is O
not O
very O
smoked. O

The O
non-smoking O
room O
was O
occupied O
for O
the O
wedding, O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
book O
a O
table O
in O
the O
smoking O
room. O

From O
the O
downside: O
there O
is O
no O
wardrobe. B-TARGET

It O
is O
not O
pleasant O
when O
someone O
stands O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
waits O
at O
the O
table O
in O
the O
upper O
clothes O
of O
his O
friends. O

Clothes B-TARGET
are O
overloaded O
and O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
sit O
next O
to O
them. O

There O
are O
many O
waiters, B-TARGET
but O
catching O
one O
is O
very O
difficult. O

Perhaps O
we O
were O
at O
peak O
hour. O

Drinks O
(not O
cocktails) O
waited O
30 O
minutes O
from O
the O
time O
of O
order. O

Girls B-TARGET
administrators I-TARGET
do O
not O
have O
badges O
and O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
distinguish O
them O
from O
guests. O

The O
menu B-TARGET
does O
not O
specify O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
portions. O

When O
asked O
by O
a O
waiter, B-TARGET
she O
turns O
her O
eyes O
and O
remembers O
what O
the O
dish O
looks O
like. O

She B-TARGET
did O
not O
like O
it, O
it O
was O
frozen O
and O
tasteless. O

Yesterday O
we O
decided O
to O
open O
another O
Italian O
restaurant. O

Super O
Mario O
advised O
the O
familiar. O

That's O
where O
they O
went. O

They O
were O
not O
disappointed, O
but O
were O
not O
particularly O
satisfied. O

The O
first O
impression O
was O
not O
very: O
pretty O
boring O
interior, B-TARGET
little O
space O
and O
only O
one O
table O
was O
occupied O
- O
and O
this O
is O
on O
a O
weekend O
or O
a O
night... O

But O
still O
decided O
to O
drink O
coffee. O

I O
ordered O
myself O
a O
latte B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
a O
baseball O
- O
served O
quickly, O
very O
tasty!! O

My O
husband O
took O
the O
green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
- O
too O
good. O

We O
softened O
and O
decided O
to O
try: O
I O
ordered O
mushroom B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
cream, I-TARGET
it O
turned O
out O
tasteless, O
but O
even O
a O
large O
portion. B-TARGET

My O
husband's O
chicken B-TARGET
broth I-TARGET
was O
literally O
on O
3 O
tablespoons O
- O
very O
little. O

The B-TARGET
bread I-TARGET
basket I-TARGET
is O
boring O
and O
not O
particularly O
tasty. O

Lausanne's B-TARGET
husband O
is O
so O
selfish... O

But O
I O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
tiramisu B-TARGET
- O
tasty, O
but O
served O
in O
a O
beautiful O
glass.. O

In O
general, O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
small, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
very. O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
really O
delicious. O

Huge O
plus- O
toilet. B-TARGET

Very O
clean, O
neat, O
towels O
all O
kinds O
and O
spacious O
- O
and O
after O
all O
a O
good O
toilet B-TARGET
- O
it O
is O
also O
very O
important O
for O
the O
restaurant, O
I O
believe. O

The B-TARGET
officials I-TARGET
are O
polite... O

they O
can O
put O
a O
quarter O
on O
the O
5th O
scale. O

It O
was O
sad O
that O
we O
washed O
the O
floors O
in O
the O
hall O
at O
the O
entrance O
- O
and O
we O
observed O
it. O

The O
account O
is O
normal, O
not O
very O
expensive, O
but O
also O
cheap. O

In O
general O
once O
looked..there O
are O
places O
better, O
for O
these O
money O
the O
more. O

So O
will O
we O
save O
it O
back O
there. O

Hello O
everyone, O
recently O
we O
were O
in O
a O
restaurant, O
we O
live O
nearby. O

We O
went O
to O
dinner, O
were O
satisfied, O
everything O
was O
very O
good. O

The B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
is O
spacious O
but O
very O
cosy. O

The B-TARGET
waiter I-TARGET
accepted O
the O
order, O
it O
took O
a O
while O
to O
wait. O

The O
company O
we O
have O
different, O
so O
the O
dishes O
ordered O
also O
different, O
to O
whom O
what. O

Everything O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
delicious, O
salads, B-TARGET
soup, B-TARGET
sausages B-TARGET
from I-TARGET
bacon I-TARGET
- O
just O
a O
song. O

The O
ball B-TARGET
went O
to O
Ura! O

With O
a O
beer! O

The O
wine B-TARGET
is O
excellent, O
it O
may O
not O
be O
cooked O
in O
this O
restaurant, O
but O
no O
one O
had O
any O
claim O
to O
the O
taste O
qualities, O
everything O
fresh. O

All O
the O
children O
remained O
satisfied O
and O
satisfied. O

Even O
our O
child O
who O
ordered O
the O
dessert B-TARGET
also O
said O
it O
was O
delicious, O
so O
in O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
you O
can O
also O
drink O
the O
company O
beer O
and O
simply O
have O
dinner O
with O
the O
family. O

Recommend) O

first O
time O
wanted O
to O
write O
a O
review O
of O
the B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
since O
there O
was O
a O
really O
pleasant O
impression... O

very O
cozy O
interior O
and O
picturesque O
location, O
although O
the O
building O
of O
the O
Savings O
Bank O
nearby O
damages O
the O
painting... O
but O
that O
is O
another O
question. O

from O
the O
kitchen O
- O
I O
tried O
two O
dishes: O
dorada O
baked O
and O
pasta O
with O
spinach. O

Dorada B-TARGET
is O
decent, O
I O
really O
liked O
the O
sauce, B-TARGET
which O
makes O
80% O
of O
the O
success O
of O
the O
dish. O

The O
pasta B-TARGET
was O
a O
little O
less O
impressive, O
perhaps O
because O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
on O
a O
hungry O
stomach O
and O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
was O
not O
ideally O
tender O
as O
dreamed. O

Portions B-TARGET
and O
the O
truth O
is O
not O
so O
large, O
but O
all O
very O
carefully O
and O
in O
the O
right O
quantity. O
ideal O
to O
feel O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dish, O
but O
not O
to O
be O
overwhelmed. O

The O
black B-TARGET
cedar I-TARGET
was O
also O
very O
nice, O
made O
with O
taste. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
very O
satisfying: O
when O
I O
cleaned O
the O
fish O
- O
I O
was O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
- O
it O
is O
already O
a O
level. O

In O
my O
opinion, O
in O
the O
pineapple B-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
for O
300 O
r O
added O
sugar, O
if O
it O
is O
so O
- O
then O
it O
is O
rather O
negative, O
because O
it O
kills O
the O
whole O
natural O
taste... O

In O
general, O
I O
liked O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
are O
clearly O
ready O
for O
continuous O
improvement O
and O
respect O
their O
clients. O

it O
buys O
the O
most. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
back O
and O
try O
a O
couple O
of O
desserts O
and O
soup O
soup O
with O
spinach...to O
start=) O

I O
recommend O
to O
all O
places, O
it O
is O
a O
restaurant O
that O
is O
not O
shameful O
to O
recommend O

I've O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
establishment O
and O
decided O
to O
come O
to O
this O
sports O
bar O
just O
to O
take O
a O
break O
during O
the O
day O
and O
see O
something. O

As O
usual, O
he O
took O
Caesar O
salad O
and O
ice O
cream O
with O
latte O
coffee. O

Good O
when O
in O
the O
bar O
is O
able O
and O
coffee B-TARGET
to O
cook O
delicious O
without O
burning O
it O
yes O
and O
everything O
else O
was O
done O
well O
and O
skilfully, O
orders O
brought O
me O
very O
quickly, O
if O
one O
considers O
that O
and O
in O
the O
day O
there O
were O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
people. O

There O
was O
a O
good O
atmosphere B-TARGET
of O
relaxation O
and O
freedom O
from O
everything. O

The O
correct O
interior B-TARGET
as O
in O
a O
normal O
male O
pub O
with O
adequate O
prices O
and O
beautiful O
waitresses. B-TARGET

The O
only O
downside O
for O
me O
is O
that O
the O
pub O
is O
quite O
far O
from O
home, O
but O
still O
the O
pluses O
are O
much O
more O
and O
now O
I O
know O
where O
to O
watch O
football O
and O
where O
to O
come O
in O
the O
evening) O

I O
have O
long O
wanted O
to O
visit O
this O
institution. O

09.05.2014 O
the O
table O
was O
ordered O
by O
phone O
2 O
hours O
before O
the O
visit. O

However, O
there O
were O
many O
free O
tables. O

I O
will O
be O
brief O
in O
my O
remarks. O

Kitchen B-TARGET
: O
delicious, O
all O
super O
- O
10 O
points. O

Staff: B-TARGET
polite, O
welcoming. O

Interior B-TARGET
: O
everything O
is O
simple, O
neat, O
without O
excesses. O

Cash O
amount: O
3500-3700 O
(+two O
bottles O
of O
wine). O

There O
is O
a O
non-smoking B-TARGET
room, I-TARGET
which O
is O
undoubtedly O
important. O

The O
worst O
happened O
during O
dinner! O

It O
was O
like O
a O
bad O
movie! O

My O
companion O
was O
brought O
the O
ordered O
dish, O
he O
gave O
him O
a O
good-bye, O
knocked O
(as O
he O
likes O
it O
at O
home), O
took O
a O
knife O
and O
a O
saw, O
and O
the O
waiter B-TARGET
ran O
away O
with O
the O
words O
"you O
haven't O
done O
it O
yet?". O

It O
turns O
out O
the O
couple O
at O
the O
next O
table O
ordered O
the O
same O
dish O
and O
it O
was O
intended O
for O
them. O

And O
you O
will O
not O
believe! O

After O
we O
had O
"selected" O
the O
food, O
this O
dish O
was O
taken O
to O
a O
couple O
at O
the O
next O
table! O

There O
are O
no O
words! O

The O
setting O
of O
the O
evening O
dinner O
was O
fixed. O

I O
understand, O
all O
people, O
can O
be O
wrong. O

But! O

Both O
of O
us O
and O
the O
couple O
looked O
like O
idiots O
in O
this O
situation. O

After O
all, O
it O
was O
possible O
to O
apologize O
to O
the O
couple O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
wait O
a O
little O
longer O
until O
the O
dish O
was O
ready. O

I O
think O
that O
was O
the O
only O
possible O
solution. O

Will O
I O
go O
to O
this O
institution O
again? O

It O
is O
possible, O
yes, O
but O
only O
on O
the O
bench. O
